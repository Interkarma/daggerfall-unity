<ce>                          Welcome to Bossfall!
<ce>             
<ce>            Your Ebony Dagger is very fragile. Use it wisely.
<ce>          
<ce>            Gold and high tier materials are quite rare. You
<ce>               can, however, find Daedric items anywhere.
<ce>         
<ce>         Spellcasters hurl all types of lethal magic. Oblivion
<ce>                        welcomes the unprepared.
<ce>
<ce>         Some monsters are immune to certain types of weapons.
<ce>          Punching iron or stone will only injure your fist.
<ce>
<ce>          You may have heard whispers of the dreaded Vampires.
<ce>            Their bloodlust drives them to unearthly speeds.
<ce>             You will need a horse to escape their hunger.
<ce>
<ce>         Greater enemies than Vampires lurk in dungeon depths.
<ce>        Their ill-gotten wealth rivals the splendor of Wayrest,
<ce>         but their ancient souls pulse with powers unknown...
<ce>
<ce>                             Good luck.
