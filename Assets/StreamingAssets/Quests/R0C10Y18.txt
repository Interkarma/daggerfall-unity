QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 Are you free for a few days to do me
<ce>                   a little favor, %pcf? I just need
<ce>                  something I borrowed brought back to
<ce>                 its owner. Nothing too strenuous, and
<ce>                 you'll be _reward_ gold pieces richer.
<ce>                         A tempting offer, eh?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      That's too bad. Well, I'll
<ce>                      just hire someone else then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    %oth, that's the spirit! I have
<ce>                  this _item1_ I borrowed from my good
<ce>                             friend _npc1_,
<ce>                          a priest in __npc1_
<ce>                           of ___npc1_. It's
<ce>                   somewhat of a rush to get it back
<ce>                        to %g2 -- %g needs it in
<ce>                     =1stparton_ days. So please do
<ce>                    hurry. Thank you for this, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     Didn't I say to hurry, %pcf?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      Ah, good. The _item2_ is as
<ce>                    exquisite as I'd been told. Fine
<ce>                    work, %pcf. Here's your _reward_
<ce>                    gold for your speed and silence.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There's been lots of traffic to and from __npc1_. Wonder what's going on.
<--->
_npc1_ has been looking for %g3 _item1_, but I didn't even know %g liked those things.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I wonder how long __npc1_ has been used as a smuggling station. It's a scandal.
<--->
They were smuggling gems in _item1_s. It seems so obvious now, don't you think?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Funny. I know there was a shipment of _item1_s to __npc1_ but they didn't seem right.
<--->
___npc2_ is said to be a hotbed of _item2_ smuggling. Must be well-disguised.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Look who's back. You understand I couldn't tell you about the gem, don't you?
<--->
Well, if it isn't %pcf. Great job with that gem smuggling business, my friend.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      That was no small quest you
<ce>                          failed, %pcf. Maybe
<ce>                       I can forgive you in time.
<ce>                                 Maybe.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                Oh good, my _item1_'s back. Thank you,
<ce>                      %pcf. But there seems to be
<ce>                       something stuck in it. Oh,
<ce>                   I see ... this stone. Would you be
<ce>                 good enough to bring this pebble over
<ce>                           to _questgiver_'s
<ce>                        friend, _npc2_, over at
<ce>                          __npc2_ in ___npc2_?
<ce>                  I believe %g has your gold, but you
<ce>                          better hurry. _npc2_
<ce>                   runs out of patience if %g has to
<ce>                   wait longer than =2ndparton_ days.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
_questgiver_
 of ___questgiver_ has sent me
 to bring a _item1_ to a priest in
 ___npc1_, a certain
 =npc1_ named _npc1_
 I'll find in __npc1_ if I
 get there in =1stparton_ days or
 less.

Message:  1016
%qdt:
 There was a _item2_ hidden
 in the _item1_. For the
 _reward_ gold I was promised, I have to
 deliver the _item2_ to a third party
 in ___npc2_, _npc2_ of
 __npc2_. I have =2ndparton_ days
 to accomplish this.

Message:  1020
<ce>                        Here in %reg, only the
<ce>                      Thieves Guild is allowed to
<ce>                     smuggle. I guess _questgiver_
<ce>                    thought %g was above the rules.
<ce>                     %g was wrong. You're going to
<ce>                       give me that _item2_, and
<ce>                     _questgiver_ is going to learn
<ce>                        not to cross the Thieves
<ce>                    Guild. Do it, or I'll kill you.

Message:  1021
<ce>                      You tell everyone you know
<ce>                      not to mess with the Thieves
<ce>                      Guild. Now get out of here.
