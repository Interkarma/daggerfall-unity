<ce>           As the premier research institution in the Empire
<ce>            of Tamriel, the Mages Guild employs a number of
<ce>                mystics and scholars all over the land.
<ce>            If we can get a representative of the Guild over
<ce>            to a place within a reasonable distance of here,
<ce>                    the eminent scholar, _scholar_,
<ce>            has agreed to share %g3 research. Would you
<ce>                         be available for this?
                                     <--->
<ce>                     The Mages Guild of ___qgiver_
<ce>            has an exciting opportunity to benefit from the
<ce>              work of the renowned researcher and scholar,
<ce>                   _scholar_. %g has agreed to donate
<ce>              some of %g3 research to the Guild if we send
<ce>                 someone to ___scholar_ to pick it up.
<ce>                 Not surprisingly, %g fears Necromancer
<ce>             intervention. I take it that you're as excited
<ce>                 about this possibility as I am, %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  That's rather disappointing, %pct.
<ce>             If I were in better condition, I'd jump at the
<ce>                  chance to meet the great _scholar_.
<ce>                    You're wasting your youth, %pct.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Grand, just grand. Now, _scholar_
<ce>                  is staying in ___scholar_ in a place
<ce>                    called __scholar_ for just a few
<ce>              days. The danger is the Necromancers. Those
<ce>               reprobate spellslingers are interested in
<ce>                      getting to _scholar_ and %g3
<ce>            research. I will give you =queston_ days to get
<ce>                         to _scholar_ and back
<ce>                 before I send someone else. Good luck.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              Oh, this is brilliant stuff. I guess those
<ce>               damned Necromancers were not too difficult
<ce>               to handle, at least, not for you. Spiffing
<ce>                               job, %pct.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Maybe that _scholar_ is a celebrity to scholar types, but %g's just a =scholar_
<--->
It's an honor for ___scholar_ to host the renowned _scholar_'s visit to %reg.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The Necromancers will be the dominant magical power in Tamriel in a few years.
<--->
The Mages Guild is unable to defend itself against the Necromancers.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_scholar_'s research will help the Mages Guild in a number of ways.
<--->
The Necromancers didn't seem to get their hands on _scholar_ ... or did they?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Well, if it isn't the %ra who brought us that manuscript. How are you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 As you haven't got the manuscript you
<ce>                 swore you would retrieve, I see little
<ce>                   point in conversing with you. Take
<ce>                        your business elsewhere.

 The Mages Guild of ___qgiver_
 has sent me to ___scholar_
 where _scholar_, a renowned
 scholar, is staying at a place
 called __scholar_. I am
 to avoid the agents of the Necromancers,
 get _scholar_'s research
 from %g2 and return to the Mages Guild in
 no more than =queston_ days.

 Dear Old %pcf,
 
     Well done, %pcf. _scholar_
 was characteristically pigheaded about giving
 us %g3 research notes, but %g'd be pleased
 as a pumpkin to give it to a "representative"
 of the right-minded Mages Guild.
 
     You'll have a lovely bit of gold waiting
 for you here in ___db_ when you
 get here with the notes.
 
 
 
                               Yours,
 
 
                               _db_

Message:  1012
%pcn,
 
 
     Do not make an enemy of the Dark Brotherhood.
 We can be great help to one another, but you could
 not wish for a worse enemy. When you have
 _scholar_'s research paper, bring it to
 me here at __db_ in ___db_.
 
     Fail not, or the wrath of Mephala, Queen of
 Oblivion be on you.
 
 
                             _db_

Message:  1013
<ce>                  You're the %ra the Mages Guild sent
<ce>                over to protect my work, yes? Marvelous
<ce>                to meet you, my child. Here's the bally
<ce>                  thing. Good luck getting past those
<ce>                    infernal Necromancers with it. I
<ce>                          certainly couldn't.

Message:  1014
<ce>                        Do you give _scholar_'s
<ce>                          work to _db_ of the
<ce>                           Dark Brotherhood?

The manner by which the diastolic pressure
 of any two scarce commodities (creating a
 type of propulsion with no moving parts
 and virtual silence) has been postulated
 by thyrionic mathematicians for many years.
 In conventional thinking, the default
 parameters of any formula (objectively
 speaking, it is essential to remember that
 objectivity is indeed subjective) will
 always return to what Mornthaur called the
 "back medium." However, starting with a
 grid of complex numbers that more than covers
 the unit circle and three cube roots of one,
 we can backtrace, by uptracking the negative
 "half numbers," and create an infinite basin
 with dual natures of blackness and whiteness.
 The rate of adiabatic cooling or warming in
 unsaturated air can thus be made directly
 proportional to the fourth power of its
 absolute temperature.

Message:  1016
When white light is passed through a gas
 under a medium dense gas at a high temperature,
 a dynamic thermal instability occurs. Since
 magicka is usually a very faint source of
 illumination, gases, under much greater
 pressure, are forced to combine with degenerated
 matter, creating dual forces, beyond and
 beneath. The end result is a quasi-horizontal
 chonolith composed of anastomosing ductoliths,
 whose distal ends curl like a harpolith, thin
 like a sphenolith, or bulge discordantly like
 an akmolith or ethmolith. There are thus five
 elements that must be contributed towards a
 universal confederation of what Galerion
 Vanus called "gray matter" -- perception,
 evidence, essense, morality, and extraction.

Message:  1017
_scholar_ is only one of the most respected scholars in Tamriel
<--->
_scholar_ is a =scholar_, a very well-respected scholar
<--->
_scholar_ is only going to be visiting %reg for a short time
<--->
One of the finest minds of the third era, so they say
<--->
_scholar_ would definitely agree that %g's a genius
<--->
_scholar_ is a typical intellectual. No idea of what's going on
<--->
_scholar_'s very clever, but %g3 brains sometimes go to %g3 head
<--->
Talk to _db_ over in ___db_ -- %g's been asking about _scholar_ too.
<--->
A =db_ in __db_ was asking about _scholar_ as well.

Message:  1018
<ce>                  What a thoughtful gift. I hope your
<ce>                Mages Guild pals aren't too upset about
<ce>                 losing it. What would they know about
<ce>                 practical application of dry research
<ce>               anyhow? Here, take _dbgold_ gold for your
<ce>                 trouble. Buy yourself something nice.

Message:  1019
<ce>                 How kind. The Dark Brotherhood would
<ce>               gratefully offer you _dbgold_ gold pieces
<ce>                for your service. In addition, here's a
<ce>                little something I whipped together that
<ce>                should keep you from getting in trouble
<ce>                      with _qgiver_ and the other
<ce>                 Mages Guildmembers. All research notes
<ce>                look alike anyhow. When they don't yield
<ce>                results, the Guild will just throw more
<ce>                assistants at it or give up the project
<ce>                  in embarrassment. The Mages Guild is
<ce>                  simply a tedious pack of researchers
<ce>                   who don't have to worry about gold
<ce>                  and thus are never happier than when
<ce>                     they are doing pointless work.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I received a threatening letter from
 _db_ of the Dark Brotherhood,
 telling me to bring _scholar_'s
 research paper to __db_ in
 ___db_ instead of the Mages Guild.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 _db_ of the Dark Brotherhood
 sent me a letter, congratulating me on my
 guile, and telling me that %g would be at
 a place called __db_ in ___db_
 with a gold reward for bringing the
 research paper to %g2 instead of the
 Mages Guild.

Message:  1022
<ce>                     A young lad with fierce eyes
<ce>                      hands you a letter and runs
<ce>                         away into the alleys.
