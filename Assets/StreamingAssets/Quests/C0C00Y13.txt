QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                       Blessings upon you, %pcn,
<ce>                     even though you are a heathen
<ce>                        and do not patronize our
<ce>                         temple. I am _qgiver_.
<ce>                      So you are looking to curry
<ce>                         favor with __qgiver_.
<ce>                        Deliver this _religitem_
<ce>                          to ___priest_ within
<ce>                      =traveltime_ days and I can
<ce>                           speak well of you.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     It is your loss. Ask not for
<ce>                      the favor of this temple any
<ce>                            time soon, %pcn.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       Here is the _religitem_.
<ce>                          Take it to _priest_
<ce>                      of __priest_ in ___priest_.
<ce>                     Oh, I almost forgot to mention
<ce>                        that a rival temple may
<ce>                      send out thugs to stop you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       The god's favor upon you
<ce>                         %pcn. This _religitem_
<ce>                         is sorely needed here.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
It's a race between two temples for that _religitem_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_priest_ never got %g3 _religitem_ and _qgiver_ is wroth.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_priest_ and __qgiver_ managed to get that _religitem_ thanks to a brave %ra.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
%god bless you, of course I remember %pcf. How are you, my child?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
_priest_ never got the _religitem_ and I am not amused.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_, of __qgiver_,
 has given me a charge to
 deliver the _religitem_
 to _priest_ in __priest_ in
 ___priest_. It must be there within =traveltime_ days.

Message:  1011
<ce>                         That _religitem_ will
<ce>                      never make it to __priest_.
<ce>                        Instead, I shall deliver
<ce>                            them your head!
