<ce>                         _knight_ is half out
<ce>                    of %g3 mind, %pcf. What a terror
<ce>                           you are. %vam feel
<ce>                    that you deserve this _jewelry_
<ce>                   in recognition of your loyalty and
<ce>                    remarkable ... restraint in this
<ce>                     matter. Well done, tribesman.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
If _knight_ doesn't watch out, those vampires are going to turn on %g2.
<--->
_knight_ thinks %g knows about vampires. But %g's a fool.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_knight_ has moved across the Bay, but %g's keeping an eye on the vampires.
<--->
_knight_'s not afraid of any vampires. Killed thousands of 'em, I hear.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_knight_ got taught the lesson of %g3 life. It doesn't pay to fight vampires.
<--->
_knight_ was a stupid do-gooder. Just leave the vampires alone, I say.

 Dear %pcn,
 
     %vam need you. Come
 immediately.
 
 
               Yours in Death,

<ce>                  Ah, good evening, my tribesman. We
<ce>                   are having difficulty with a local
<ce>                  warlord who, despite our many, many
<ce>                   polite verbal and written threats,
<ce>                    continues to wage a war against
<ce>                 %vam. Ordinarily, this irksome knight
<ce>                    would have been in the hereafter
<ce>                   weeks ago. Our mercy is not sprung
<ce>                      from sentiment. We could use
<ce>                          _knight_ as an ally
<ce>                   in %reg, but %g needs to be taught
<ce>                  obedience. I want you to have a talk
<ce>                        with %g2 in ___mondung_
<ce>                   where %g feels most secure. Don't
<ce>                  kill %g2 -- just rough %g2 up a bit.
<ce>                 I'll expect you back in =queston_ days
<ce>                           after _knight_ has
<ce>                           been ... softened.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
 I received a letter
 from _vamp_, of
 %vam of ___vamp_. I
 am needed in __vamp_
 as soon as possible.

Message:  1013
%qdt:
 _vamp_ wants me
 to go to ___mondung_
 and throttle _knight_,
 a knight who refuses to bend to the
 will of %vam. I am
 ordered not to kill %g2, just
 frighten %g2, and be back in
 ___vamp_ in =queston_ days.

Message:  1014
<ce>                         Sweet %god, tell %vam
<ce>                         that I'll do anything!
<ce>                          Just don't kill me!
                                     <--->
<ce>                          %oth, I surrender!
<ce>                      I'll do anything they want,
<ce>                      just please, in the name of
<ce>                            %god, don't kill
<ce>                                  me!

Message:  1015
<ce>                           _knight_ is dead.
<ce>                           _vamp_ will not be
<ce>                                pleased.

Message:  1016
<ce>                       I've already heard, %pcf.
<ce>                           You slew _knight_
<ce>                 though I specifically told you only to
<ce>                       frighten %g2. %oth, you're
<ce>                    no better than a thug, are you?
<ce>                          %vam and I are very
<ce>                          disappointed, %pcf.

Message:  1017
<ce>                     A pale young boy hands you a
<ce>                      letter before scurrying away
<ce>                        with surprising agility.
