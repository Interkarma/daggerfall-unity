<ce>                        %oth, bloody brilliant.
<ce>                          Go to the _mansion_
<ce>                             in __mansion_.
<ce>                           Find the _jewelry_
<ce>                         and get it back here.

<ce>                        supposed to be some sort
<ce>                        of guardian in the dump.

<ce>                            Nice work %pcn.
<ce>                         Here's your guild fee.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
They say _mansion_ is impenetrable.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Someone tried to break into _mansion_, but they failed.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_mansion_ got robbed. It seems barely conceivable.
<--->
If _mansion_ can get robbed, no place is safe.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
How are you doing, %pcf? Didn't spend all that _gold_ gold already, didja?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      %oth, it's you. The guy who
<ce>                      owns _mansion_ already moved
<ce>                   the _jewelry_, so the whole thing
<ce>                     is over. Thanks a lot for all
<ce>                       your so-called hard work.
