<ce>                     %pcf, I got a job for you if
<ce>                      you're interested.  A little
<ce>                        package needs delivering
<ce>                            to ___contact1_.
<ce>                            What do you say?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     Don't do me any favors, pal.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Great.  Here's the package, some
<ce>                      _drugs_.  It needs to be in
<ce>                        ___contact1_ as soon as
<ce>                       possible.  _contact1_ will
<ce>                     meet you there in __contact1_.
<ce>                      Be careful.  If word of this
<ce>                       shipment leaks out, we may
<ce>                    have a bit of trouble with some
<ce>                     freelance smugglers who think
<ce>                     they own the business in %reg.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  Didn't I say "as soon as possible"?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 I'm glad you made it through.  These
<ce>                 amateurs don't stand a chance against
<ce>                 our organization.  Here's _gold_ gold
<ce>                     for your services.  Good work.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>        I hear the Thieves Guild is having some trouble with an
<ce>                        upstart smuggling ring.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>       It looks like the Thieves Guild is going to have to give
<ce>                 up its monopoly on smuggling in %reg.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>     The Thieves Guild seems to have quashed those rival smugglers
<ce>                     that were giving them trouble.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>       Hey, good old %pcn, I remember you.  My reliable courier.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>So, the smuggler who can't deliver the goods returns.  What do you want?

%qdt:
 I am on my way to ___contact1_
 with a shipment of _drugs_
 for _contact1_, who will
 meet me in __contact1_.
 I was warned to watch out
 for thugs from a rival smuggling
 ring.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 I just got a note from _contact1_
 saying %g was unable to meet me in
 ___contact1_.  %g told me to
 go to ___contact2_ instead,
 and deliver the shipment to a
 =contact2_ in __contact2_.

Message:  1030
%pcn --
 
 Sorry I couldn't meet you in ___contact1_
 as planned.  The heat got too intense for me
 to wait around.  I've arranged an alternate
 drop in ___contact2_.  Look for a =contact2_
 waiting for you in __contact2_.
 
<ce>                            Watch your back,
<ce>                                    
<ce>                               _contact1_

Message:  1031
<ce>                A small, dirty boy tugs on your sleeve.
<ce>                   He hands you a scrap of paper then
<ce>                       dashes off down an alley.

Message:  1035
<ce>                When are you Thieves Guild thugs going
<ce>                  to learn that we control the _drugs_
<ce>                         business around %reg?
