<ce>                         My name is _qgiver_.
<ce>              I don't like handing out jobs to non-guild
<ce>              members. You seem like the trustworthy sort
<ce>              though. Some poor soul brought home a giant
<ce>             spider's egg that hatched. Seems they mistook
<ce>             it for a silkworm cocoon. The poor slob can't
<ce>              afford to pay us to get rid of it. However,
<ce>               if you take care of it for free the guild
<ce>             looks good and I'll make sure you look good.
<ce>                          Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     I should have known you were
<ce>                          serious about work.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     This is your shot at the big
<ce>                      time. The spider is trapped
<ce>                     in _house_. Kill it today and
<ce>                   I'll put in a good word for you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                          You got spunk %pcf.
<ce>                       Keep up the good work and
<ce>                       you'll be Fighter's Guild
<ce>                             material yet.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>               Did you hear about the idiot that brought
<ce>                home a giant spider's egg. Now he's got
<ce>                an eight legged pet thats trying to eat
<ce>                            him for dinner!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>              Some poor fool was stung and nearly killed
<ce>              by a giant spider, in his own home no less!

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>             You're that guy that killed the giant spider.
<ce>           You should join the Fighter's Guild or something.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  Nicely done with that giant spider.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                If you can't handle spiders, how do you
<ce>               expect to handle the other jobs the guild
<ce>                         might want you to do?
