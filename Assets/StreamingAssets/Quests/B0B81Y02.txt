QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                         I am _qgiver_ of this
<ce>                     knightly order. I have a most
<ce>                       dangerous quest %pcf. You
<ce>                     are one of the few that could
<ce>                    possibly take it on. A lich is
<ce>                     raising an army of undead. We
<ce>                     need someone to go in and put
<ce>                             a stop to it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                          I understand, %pcn.
<ce>                    This is too dangerous even for
<ce>                    you. There are one or two other
<ce>                     heroes that might be able to
<ce>                    pull this one off. I'll go ask
<ce>                                 them.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    You are brave indeed. The lich
<ce>                       has made ___dungeon_ into
<ce>                    its lair. Go there and destroy
<ce>                    the foul thing. In =2dung_ days
<ce>                    we will send out someone else,
<ce>                        should you not return.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        Hail to the hero, %pcn!
<ce>                       Well done! You name shall
<ce>                     be recorded in the histories.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
%reg is bracing itself for the Lich's onslaught.
<--->
All %reg is praying that ==qgiver_ can kill that Lich.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The Lich has temporarily left ___dungeon_. Temporarily.
<--->
The Lich will return to ___dungeon_. That's a certainty.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
%reg is saved, and we have ==qgiver_ to thank.
<--->
A %ra knight from ==qgiver_ defeated that Arch-Lich.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
It'd be rude of me not to help the rescuer of %reg, eh?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You're lucky that Lich didn't destroy all %reg, %pcf.
<--->
%reg was in serious danger from that Lich. And you didn't care.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 ==qgiver_ in ___qgiver_
 charged me with the duty of
 destroying the lich of
 ___dungeon_. I have =2dung_
 days to finish the task.

Message:  1011
<ce>                       The lich is dead. Without
<ce>                       his magical support, the
<ce>                      army of undead will return
<ce>                             to the grave.

Message:  1020
...have found a clue at last!
 I dare not even name the lost
 artifact of ancient power that
 it points toward. It is too
 late for me. I will die down
 here in ___dungeon2_,
 lost among it's dark passageways.
 First, I will hide my clue.
 If I cannot...

Message:  1028
<ce>                        Sorry, %pcn. You didn't
<ce>                     come back for so long that we
<ce>                    thought you were dead. Another
<ce>                    guild member took up the quest.

Message:  1030
<ce>                   You trudged all the way down here
<ce>                   to speak to me and now you don't
<ce>                   want to continue? Inconceivable!
<ce>                         Get out of my sight!

<ce>                     A pox upon you for disturbing
<ce>                       me %pcn. %oth, of course
<ce>                I know your name, and no I'm not going
<ce>                   to tell you mine. What's the use

<ce>                    know things normal folks don't.
<ce>                    I also know why your here. You
<ce>                      want Chrysamere, except you
<ce>                   didn't know it by name, did you?
<ce>                     The only way you're gonna get
<ce>                   it is if you do me a favor first.

Message:  1035
<ce>                    You see, I don't actually know
<ce>                   where your artifact is. My great
<ce>                    grandfather once sought for it.
<ce>                   According to family history, when
<ce>                   he found it the Mages Guild took
<ce>                   it from him and hid it somewhere.
<ce>                   His spirit has never rested easy
<ce>                    since. If you have this lock of
<ce>                   my hair with you when his spirit
<ce>                    is put to rest, he may tell you
<ce>                     where to find what you seek.
<ce>                        He haunts ___dungeon3_.

Message:  1040
<ce>                    You hold a token of my lineage,
<ce>                     a bit of hair from one of my
<ce>                    decendants. Know ye that I have
<ce>                     wandered these halls for long
<ce>                    decades waiting for this sign.
<ce>                       Go to the _mageguild_ in
<ce>                        __mageguild_. There you
<ce>                      will find what I once lost.

Message:  1041
%qdt:
 I have found _wizard_ in
 ___dungeon2_. I now must
 seek %g3 great grandfather in
 ___dungeon3_,
 who may be able to tell me the location
 of the artifact. _wizard_ has also given
 me a lock of %g3 hair so that I may lay him
 to rest.

Message:  1042
%qdt:
 _wizard_'s great grandfather has told me
 that I can find the artifact at _mageguild_
 in __mageguild_.
