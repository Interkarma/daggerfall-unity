<ce>                  You are even more dashing in person
<ce>                 than Lord Woodborne said. I just love
<ce>                  talking to men and women of action!
<ce>                    I know that you're looking for a
<ce>                   certain object, %pcf. A totem pole
<ce>                  or something? Well, an acquaintance
<ce>                    of mine, a perfectly delightful
<ce>                        =contact_, has something
<ce>                    that may help you. If you would
<ce>                       escort my cousin _foil_ to
<ce>                       _contact_ you can have it.
<ce>                    Would you do this teensy weensy
<ce>                             favor for me?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   No? How dreadful! My poor cousin
<ce>                    will be so disappointed. You are
<ce>                  not nearly as fun as Lord Woodborne
<ce>                           said you would be.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    How exciting! It will be a real
<ce>                    adventure. _foil_ just loves to
<ce>                travel and has been dying to spend some
<ce>                       time with _contact_. Go to
<ce>                      ___contact_ of ____contact_,
<ce>                     to a place called __contact_.
<ce>                %g will pay you =reward_ gold pieces for
<ce>                     bringing %g2 _foil_. Don't you
<ce>				  just love these dangerous missions?

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  I have nothing to discuss with you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      %pcf! How did...I mean, I'm
<ce>                      glad to see you. And _foil_
<ce>                too. Here take the gold. Object? What's
<ce>                a totem? Well, its been nice talking to
<ce>                            you. Gotta run!

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
A crowd of shady characters was here a while ago, looking for a %ra mercenary.
<--->
Princess Elysana been spending a lot of time in the Wayrest wilderness, I hear.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Hear about the gang that ambushed that %ra? Funny business that, if you ask me.
<--->
Those guys who ambushed that %ra weren't from around here. Hired assassins.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Hear some mystery man is hiring assassins to kill a certain %ra mercenary.
<--->
_contact_ was mad as can be. You'd think %g's be happy to see %g2 cousin.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 Princess Elysana has asked me to escort
 her cousin _foil_ to ___contact_
 of ____contact_ to meet _contact_. %g will pay
 me =reward_ gold, and give me something
 relative to the Totem.

Message:  1011
<ce>                    _foil_ suddenly runs away, %g2
<ce>               feet making no sound as %g disappears into
<ce>                              the shadows.

Message:  1012
<ce>                       %pcf, it wasn't my fault!
<ce>                 I was hired to set you up! Here, take
<ce>                 the _reward_ gold. Some guy in a gray
<ce>                   cloak paid me exactly that much to
<ce>                      do it. _foil_ was just some
<ce>                  whore paid to go with you. You know,
<ce>                 I just remembered. I have _bribe_ gold
<ce>                   pieces that are just too heavy to
<ce>                 carry anymore. Why don't you take them
<ce>                        and I'll just be going.

Message:  1013
Kill %pcn before too much is
 learned. Use any means.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                                 -- W.

Message:  1015
<ce>                   A street urchin races up calling
<ce>                         "Message for %pcn from
<ce>                  the man in gray." The child runs off
<ce>                  before you can grab him, leaving you
<ce>                            holding a note.

Message:  1016
%pcn,
 
 My good friend Lord Woodborne says
 you are a hero that can be trusted.
 I would be truly indebted to you if
 you would stop by some time to chat.
 Maybe you could even do something
 for me. I would be oh so grateful.
 
<ce>                            Princess Elysana
<ce>                             Castle Wayrest

Message:  1018
%pcf,
 
 If you don't want to be dead as
 Lysandus, stop your investigations
 immediately. Do you really want to
 risk your life for a dead man?
 You are being watched.

Message:  1020
<ce>                      _foil_ says "Who were those
<ce>                  barbarians? They almost killed you!
<ce>                   Maybe you should just forget about
<ce>                           Lysandus' ghost."

Message:  1021
<ce>                       _foil_ says "You're much
<ce>                          tougher than Elysana
<ce>                          said you would be."
