QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 Yes, as a matter of fact, thou could
<ce>                       help us, %pcf. We are an
<ce>                 isolated coven, viewed with fear and
<ce>                  hostility in the outside world. If
<ce>                  thou would procure for us a certain
<ce>                    rare tome being held for us in
<ce>                         ___contact_, we would
<ce>                 be happy to give you, say, a special
<ce>                  _mitem_ personally created for you.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Well, then we shall wait for the
<ce>                   next wandering traveler. Our need
<ce>                        is not that desperate.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Wouldst thou? The name of the tome is
<ce>                           _book_ -- a very
<ce>                 rare book indeed. Even if one were to
<ce>                 find a copy, the price would be quite
<ce>                 prohibitive. We are lucky, therefore,
<ce>                   to have a friend in ___contact_,
<ce>                      a =contact_ named _contact_
<ce>                who has stolen a copy. If thou wouldst
<ce>                        meet %g2 at __contact_,
<ce>                  %g will give thee the book. We will
<ce>                  expect thee back in =queston_ days.
<ce>                    After that time, the book will
<ce>                        be of no use to us. May
<ce>                     ==daedra_ watch thy journey.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Ah, there it is. I hoped you had an
<ce>                 opportunity to peruse the page, good
<ce>                       %pcf. You are not likely
<ce>                   to find its like again very soon.
<ce>                      Well, here is your _mitem_.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_contact_ is under some suspicion. They say %g consorts with witches.
<--->
_contact_, some say, is a secret witch.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_contact_ was arrested and burned at the stake. Serves %g2 right.
<--->
Poor _contact_ never could keep %g3 mouth shut. Well, 'tis shut now.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
That _contact_ was arrested, but they didn't find _book_.
<--->
They caught _contact_, but %g wasn't apparently the =contact_ who stole _book_

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Oh, hello, %pcf. I was just reading _book_ -- the copy thou got for us.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                            _book_ is lost,
<ce>                     probably forever. Now is not
<ce>                     the time to speak. Go, leave
<ce>                          ==qgiver_. Thou art
<ce>                            not wanted now.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 ==qgiver_ have sent
 me to ___contact_
 to meet a =contact_
 named _contact_ at
 __contact_ about
 a very rare book. I am to return the
 book to ==qgiver_
 in =queston_ days or less.

Message:  1011
<ce>                       Awright, %pcf, here's the
<ce>                 book. Just watch yourself. The guards
<ce>                        are combing ___contact_
<ce>                            for that thing.

Message:  1012
<ce>                             Stop! Thief!

Message:  1013
<ce>                         It suddenly occurs to
<ce>                     you that the witches expected
<ce>                     the book at this very moment.
