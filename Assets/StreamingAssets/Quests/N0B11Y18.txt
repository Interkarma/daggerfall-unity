QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               You are a loyal member of the Mages Guild,
<ce>                 are you not, %pct?  I have some guild
<ce>                  business of the gravest import that
<ce>                      I would like you to handle.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Perhaps you are not as loyal as I thought.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Very good. There is a rebel mage that we
<ce>                need eliminated, by the name of _rebel_.
<ce>              A former pupil of mine, showed some promise
<ce>            but lacked the loyalty to the ancient principles
<ce>               of the Guild that are so important to its
<ce>               continued survival.  We have learned that
<ce>            %g is currently doing some kind of unsanctioned
<ce>               research over in ___rebelhouse_, apparently
<ce>            oblivious to %g3 danger.  You have =qtime_ days
<ce>            to dispose of this menace and report back to me.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                             Begone, %pcn.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   I made this _reward_ myself as a
<ce>               token of my appreciation for your service
<ce>                          to the Mages Guild.

%qdt:
 I have undertaken to find and
 destroy a rebel mage, who currently
 resides in ___rebelhouse_.  Once I
 have disposed of this mage, _rebel_,
 I am to report back to _questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_'s Mages Guild.
 I have =qtime_ days.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 I agreed to spare _rebel_'s life.
 He said I should just tell _questgiver_
 that I found no sign of _rebel_ in 
 ___rebelhouse_, except for a letter which
 he gave me.

Message:  1030
<ce>                   So, _questgiver_ has sent another
<ce>                  of %g3 lackeys to bring me to heel.
<ce>                 The old women who run the Mages Guild
<ce>               have no sense of adventure, take no risks,
<ce>                dare nothing, and learn nothing.  I have
<ce>               never lifted a finger against them, except
<ce>                to repudiate their control.  Yet, simply
<ce>               because I refuse to abide by their rules,
<ce>               the Mages Guild would slay me!  Why do you
<ce>               give them your blind obedience, killing on
<ce>                command like a hired assassin?  Join me
<ce>                       and we will defy them all!

Message:  1031
<ce>                Wonderful!  Just tell old _questgiver_
<ce>               that I was not here, but left this letter
<ce>                  for %g2.  I must depart, but I will
<ce>                  contact you as soon as I can cook us
<ce>                 up a truly smashing adventure.  Ta ta!

Message:  1032
<ce>                Well then, I shall have to convince you
<ce>               the hard way.  Defend yourself, mageling!

Message:  1040
Dear _questgiver_,
 
   So sorry I missed you.  I would love
 to catch up on old times with you. Do you
 remember the days when I dutifully learned
 at your knee, as if you had more to teach me
 than the stale repetition of past greatness?
 =mage1_, the Archmagister =mage3_ --
 in their day the Mages Guild was an institution
 worthy of respect.  No more. I cannot offer my
 allegiance to a Guild whose sole purpose is to
 quash all original thought.
 
   If you send more of your enforcers against
 me, I will be forced to defend myself.  Consider
 yourself warned.
 
<ce>                           Your humble pupil,
<ce>                                    
<ce>                                _rebel_

Message:  1041
<ce>                     Why...that impertinent!  I am
<ce>                      speechless!  You can now see
<ce>                      why _rebel_ must be stopped
<ce>                   at all costs, before he undermines
<ce>                    everything the Guild stands for.
<ce>                   It is unfortunate that you missed
<ce>                 that miserable little sot, but I have
<ce>                       no doubt that we will soon
<ce>                         track him down again.

Message:  1042
<ce>                   Very good, %pct.  The Mages Guild
<ce>                  cannot survive if we do not enforce
<ce>                 our own rules, harsh as they may seem.

Message:  1050
<ce>                    Stop this pointless attack, and
<ce>                            join me instead!

Message:  1051
<ce>                    Surely you are ready to concede
<ce>              my point.  We could have such fun together!

Message:  1052
<ce>               _questgiver_ has taught you persistence,
<ce>                at least.  But why remain a slave to the
<ce>                rules and regulations of the hidebound?
<ce>                  Join my merry band of Guild defiers!

Message:  1053
<ce>                 You are beginning to try my patience,
<ce>                  but I will give you one last chance.
<ce>                   Cease your attack, and I will let
<ce>                          bygones be bygones.

Message:  1060
<ce>                 Perhaps we should take this outside.

Message:  1061
<ce>                          Yoo-hoo, over here!

Message:  1062
<ce>               Did _questgiver_ forget to tell you about
<ce>               my skill in magicka when %g was preaching
<ce>                about my disloyalty and insubordination?

Message:  1063
<ce>          Missed me again, my good Guild Drone.  Why haven't
<ce>              your Guild masters taught you these tricks?
