<ce>                   You know in your heart that even
<ce>                  if _qgiver_ speaks on your behalf,
<ce>                your reputation will never be the same.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
They always have the best information in _inn_, __inn_.
<--->
_inn_ of __inn_ is the only place I'd go for really choice information.
<--->
When they find that %ra thief, there's going to be a real hanging party.
<--->
Poor _qgiver_, but that %ra's gonna pay twice the price of that _gem_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
All evidence definitely points to %pcn as the ___qgiver_ thief.
<--->
_qgiver_ is continuing the search for that %ra, almost obsessively.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
It turned out that %pcn was innocent of the ___qgiver_ robbery.
<--->
That %ra mercenary was proven innocent of the ___qgiver_ robbery.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I still feel terrible about wrongly accusing you, %pcf.

%qdt:
 _qgiver_, a
 =qgiver_ in __qgiver_ of
 ___qgiver_ suddenly accused me of
 burglary, that I stole %g3 _gem_. I am,
 naturally, innocent, but it would appear
 that I will have to prove it if I want to
 show my face in %reg again.

Message:  1011
Poor _qgiver_ lost %g3 _gem_. A witness saw a %ra, like you, at __qgiver_.
<--->
_qgiver_ is still trying to track down the %ra adventurer who stole that gem.

Message:  1012
_merchant_ is a hard-working, basically honest __merchanthome_ merchant.
<--->
Not one to overcharge customers, that _merchant_. At least not too much.
<--->
_merchant_, eh? You'll find %g2 over in _merchanthome_, __merchanthome_ this time of day.
<--->
If you listened to _priest_, _merchant_ is a blight on all of %reg.
<--->
_merchant_ gets along with most everyone, but %g doesn't like _thief_.

Message:  1013
_noble_ is of the royal house of __noblehome_. %oth, %g3 family has ruled forever.
<--->
_noble_ is a typical member of %g3 class -- decadent, ruthless, arrogant.
<--->
_noble_ spends %g3 time over in the _noblehome_, __noblehome_ this time of day.
<--->
_thief_ isn't too fond of _noble_, but most everyone else is.
<--->
_noble_ has had a longstanding disdain for ==priest_ and _priest_ specifically

Message:  1014
_priest_ is a cleric of ==priest_, of course, and quite a zealous one too.
<--->
_priest_ has risen above the scandals that plagued %g3 early days in ==priest_.
<--->
_priest_ usually can be found in meditation at _priesthome_, __priesthome_ right about now.
<--->
Most everyone in __priesthome_, except _noble_, greatly respect _priest_.
<--->
The only person _priest_ obviously dislikes is that =merchant_, _merchant_.

Message:  1015
_thief_, well, %g's a retired jewel thief. Or semi-retired, as I understand.
<--->
_thief_ used to be quite a jewel thief in __thiefhome_ once upon a time.
<--->
Someone told me that _thief_ lurks about _thiefhome_ this time everyday.
<--->
_merchant_ doesn't believe that _thief_ has reformed %g3 life at all.
<--->
_thief_ dislikes _noble_, despite the =noble_'s aristocratic blood.

Message:  1016
_witness_ is the name of that =witness_ who saw the theft at __qgiver_.
<--->
_witness_ is just a =witness_. You can find %g2 over in __witness_, ___witness_.

<ce>             A ragged beggar boy suddenly thrusts a letter
<ce>            in your hands and disappears before you have a

Message:  1018
My Dear, Dear %pcn,
 
    Sorry for this inelegant but expediential means of
 communication. Our enemies have made quite a mess of
 your, well, shall we say, not-quite-but-almost snow white
 life. As much as we respect and admire thievery, as you
 did not commit these particular honors, we think it best
 that you expose the true architect to the eyes and
 nooses of the admiring public.
     The person with whom it would be most efficacious
 for you to speak is _witness_, a
 =witness_ you may find lolling about
 _inn_. You will probably not
 find %g2 the friendliest of persons. After all, %g is
 the witness who saw you at __qgiver_'s,
 stealing the _gem_. Nevertheless, with a little
 effort, you might gain some information from the
 encounter.
     Good luck, my dear. There is surely nothing more
 tiresome than being accused of an act of wanton,
 diabolic avarice for which you are uncharacteristically
 innocent.

Message:  1019
Dear %pcf,
 
      We know all about being falsely accused of crimes,
 but we are seldom in a position to combat the accusations.
 In your case, we are at least aware of the name of one of
 your accusers -- _witness_. I do
 not know if %g is working for one of your enemies or ours,
 or is a completely innocent pawn, but %g was allegedly the
 witness to the burglary at __qgiver_.
       Be careful speaking with _witness_ --
 %g may have powerful friends. Your best bet may be in
 speaking with %g2 in public. I understand that %g frequents
 _inn_ in __inn_.

%pcf,
 
      Awright, this is gonna be a quick note, but your
 pals in the Thieves Guild want to help you out. Now
 we don't know who actually took that _gem_
 from __qgiver_, but we know you didn't.
 Let's face it -- if you had taken that _gem_,
 you wouldn't be in near as much trouble. You're a
 smart kid, smart enough to get away with it. But
 someone is framing you.
       The person who identified a %ra
 who looked like you stealing the _gem_ was a
 certain =witness_ by the name of
 _witness_. Couldn't tell you whether %g's
 telling the truth or not, whether %g saw someone
 who looked like you or not, but we figure you can
 make those inquiries yourself. You can find this
 _witness_ in a tavern
 called _inn_ right in __inn_.
 Just watch out for yourself. This ain't a game.

Message:  1021
Dear Friend,
 
      I know you didn't do it. You didn't steal
 that _gem_ outta __qgiver_
 any more than I did. Who do I suspect? Well,
 there's this =priest_
 in __priesthome_ who would be
 just as happy stealing gems and framing people
 as I would be drinking a cool ale on a hot
 summertide day.
      I don't have any evidence, but you might
 wanna check into %g2. The name of this cleric
 is _priest_. Good luck.

Message:  1022
%pcn,
 
     You dont know me and I dont owe you any
 favors and even after this you dont owe me
 nothing, you unnderstand? I used to work for
 this =merchant_ by a name
 of _merchant_. Now %g was a
 crazy one, %g was. Always trying to find a
 way to get rich. And always quick to blame
 someone else when %g got caught with %g3
 hands in the cookie jar. That's how I got
 put away.
     If I was you Id look to see if my old
 freind had something to do with the steeling
 at __qgiver_.

Message:  1023
Dear %pcn,
 
     Please forgive this intrusion. I am
 quite certain that your mind is on other
 subjects than polite chitchat, so I will
 come right to the point. I do not believe
 that you were responsible for the burglary
 in __qgiver_, but unless
 you prove yourself innocent, you will be
 forevermore persecuted for it.
     There is a =noble_
 of my acquaintance who I believe knows more
 about the affair than most. It may be that
 %g even arranged or even committed the
 crime. I can say no more, except that %g3
 name is _noble_ and %g lives
 in __noblehome_.
     And one final thing: %g has very
 powerful friends. Do not face %g2 at a
 disadvantage.
 
<ce>                               A Friend

Message:  1024
Dear %pcn,
 
      Perhaps it would interest you to know
 that there is at least one person who doesn't
 think you did it. Or maybe I should say
 two people in __thiefhome_
 don't think you did it. Me and the one who
 did it -- a =thief_ who
 did do the burglary.
      Now, the truth is that I don't have any
 proof, but _thief_, that's
 the =thief_, has done that
 kind of jewel-robbing before. %oth, %g
 even spent time in jail for it.
      So, maybe _thief_ didn't
 do it. Maybe. But if %g didn't, I can tell
 you this -- %g knows more about who really
 did it than you do. So if you want to find
 out who did it and who's framing you, go
 find this _thief_ and
 ask %g2 some questions.

Message:  1026
%qdt:
 I received a letter
 from the Necromancers, telling me about
 the =witness_ who supposedly
 saw me in __qgiver_, stealing
 the _gem_. The person's name is
 _witness_ and %g frequents
 _inn_.

Message:  1027
%qdt:
 The Agents of the
 Underking sent me a letter, identifying
 the =witness_ who said
 %g saw a %ra like me stealing
 the _gem_ from __qgiver_.
 _witness_ may be an innocent
 pawn or an agent of one of my enemies. I
 will not know until I speak with %g2
 at _inn_ here in
 __inn_.

Message:  1028
%qdt:
 The Thieves Guild
 sent me a letter, letting me know that
 they know that I'm innocent of the
 burglary. They also mentioned the name
 of the =witness_ who
 said %g saw me stealing that _gem_.
 _witness_ frequents a
 tavern called _inn_.
 I should pay my respects.

Message:  1029
%qdt:
 I received a letter
 from an anonymous friend, identifying
 a =priest_ named
 _priest_ as a possible
 agent behind the _gem_ burglary
 for which I've been framed.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 Someone sent me a
 letter about a =merchant_
 named _merchant_ who would
 be just the type to steal that _gem_
 and set me up to take the punishment.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 According to a letter
 I was sent anonymously, there is an aristocrat
 named _noble_ in __noblehome_
 who may know quite a bit about what really
 happened at __qgiver_.

Message:  1032
%qdt:
 I was sent a letter
 from an anonymous source identifying
 someone named _thief_
 as a notorious jewel-thief living right
 in __thiefhome_. Even if %g
 didn't actually rob __qgiver_,
 a conference may reveal who did.

%qdt:
 _witness_
 apparently slipped me a note when I
 talked to %g2 and %g called for the
 guards. I have been asked to meet %g2
 at a place called _withouse_.

Message:  1035
<ce>                      Thank %god you got my note.
<ce>               I'm sorry about calling the guard, but I
<ce>               couldn't be seen talking to you. Listen,
<ce>                I can't talk long, but I know now that
<ce>                you didn't do it. I told the truth when
<ce>                      I said I saw a %ra like you
<ce>                   stealing the _gem_ at __qgiver_,
<ce>                but then I saw something else. There's
<ce>                         this =merchant_ named
<ce>                       _merchant_ who, I guess,
<ce>               found out that you were in town and hired
<ce>               someone who looks a lot like you to steal
<ce>                      the _gem_ and hide it away.
<ce>                If you want to clear your name, get the
<ce>                        gem out of ___mondung_,
<ce>                        where _merchant_ has it
<ce>               stashed, or see if you can find any other
<ce>                       evidence in _thiefhouse_,
<ce>                      where _merchant_ hangs out.
<ce>                      Now, I gotta go. Good luck.

Message:  1036
<ce>                Listen, you gotta believe me. I really
<ce>               saw a %ra like you take the _gem_, and I
<ce>              thought it was you. But that's before I saw
<ce>                   _noble_'s cousin in __noblehome_.
<ce>              That kid looks almost exactly like you, and
<ce>                     I happen to know that _noble_
<ce>                    sent %g3 cousin to ___mondung_
<ce>                just recently. It'd be a great place to
<ce>                  stash a _gem_. The only other good
<ce>                     choice would be _thiefhouse_,
<ce>                     where _noble_ stays at night.
<ce>               As soon as I saw that cousin, I knew you
<ce>                were innocent. But you're going to have
<ce>                to get the evidence yourself. I have to
<ce>                      go now. Good luck, friend.

Message:  1037
<ce>               I wasn't lying when I said I saw someone
<ce>               who looked like you steal that _gem_ from
<ce>                    __qgiver_. Then I saw that %ra
<ce>                   again at _priesthome_, talking to
<ce>                     _priest_, one of the priests
<ce>                there. I overheard the two of them say
<ce>                     something about ___mondung_,
<ce>                   and I then followed that %ra down
<ce>                         to _thiefhouse_. From
<ce>                  there, the %ra went to ___mondung_.
<ce>                 A few minutes later, you came into my
<ce>                 tavern. No one will believe your and
<ce>                       my word against _priest_.
<ce>              You're going to have to find some evidence,
<ce>                       either at ___mondung_ or
<ce>                      _thiefhouse_ to clear your
<ce>                   name. Now, I must go. Good luck.

Message:  1038
<ce>               I guess you got my note. I'm really sorry
<ce>                 all this happened, %pcf, but I really
<ce>              did see someone who looked exactly like you
<ce>                  steal the _gem_ from __qgiver_. The
<ce>            person who did it was a master of disguise -- a
<ce>                      master thief named _thief_.
<ce>            Shortly after the burglary, I was walking past
<ce>                      _thiefhouse_ when I heard a
<ce>            voice which I recognized as the thief's, saying
<ce>                something about a stash in ___mondung_.
<ce>             When I saw who was speaking, I recognized the
<ce>                     renowned _thief_. These days
<ce>              %g is a respectable member of the community
<ce>               and it will take evidence to convict %g2.
<ce>              I can't help you there, but I imagine what
<ce>                      you need is in _thiefhouse_
<ce>                      and ___mondung_. Good luck.

Message:  1039
<ce>                 You got my note, I see. Listen, %pcf,
<ce>               I know that you didn't burgle __qgiver_,
<ce>           but you have to understand that my life won't be
<ce>           worth a silver if they see us talking. I work for
<ce>                       _merchant_, which may not
<ce>             mean anything to you, but believe you me, %g
<ce>                 practically runs __merchanthome_. If
<ce>             you want to clear your name and implicate my
<ce>              boss, you're going to have to get some hard
<ce>             evidence. If I were you, I'd either leave the
<ce>                 region, or look for something on %g2
<ce>                      at _thiefhouse_, %g3 house
<ce>                  in town, or ___mondung_, %g3 secret
<ce>              treasure trove. Now, I gotta go. You never

<ce>                  Listen and listen carefully, %pcf.
<ce>            This is what happened. I witnessed the burglary
<ce>                   at __qgiver_, but I knew that if
<ce>           I told the truth about who really did it, no one
<ce>           would believe me and I'd probably get hanged for
<ce>            treason. So, I told everyone a stranger did it.
<ce>            Specifically, you. The real burglar is someone
<ce>                      beyond suspicion -- _noble_
<ce>               of the royal house of %reg. You're going
<ce>             to need some evidence to prove it and I'm not
<ce>             going to stick my neck out anymore. The only
<ce>            other thing I can tell you is that, during the
<ce>                       weekends, _noble_ spends
<ce>                      %g3 time at ___mondung_ and
<ce>                      at night, at _thiefhouse_.
<ce>            Hope you can find some evidence in one of those
<ce>                   places. Good luck and I'm sorry.

<ce>                   Hi, %pcf. I couldn't talk to you
<ce>             at the tavern -- it was too public. I really
<ce>              was a witness at the burglary at __qgiver_.
<ce>           In fact, I did it. But the one who paid me to do
<ce>           it and the one who said I should blame a stranger
<ce>                        for it was _priest_, a
<ce>                    priest of ==priest_. Obviously,
<ce>            no one's going to believe you if you just come
<ce>            out and say it. You're going to need evidence.
<ce>                I can tell you that I stashed the _gem_
<ce>                  in a place called ___mondung_, but
<ce>           just getting the gem back isn't going to convince
<ce>                   anyone. Check out _thiefhouse_ --
<ce>                  _priest_ spends a lot of time there
<ce>             at night. Maybe you can find something on %g2
<ce>              there. Now, I have to go. I'll deny all of
<ce>                   this conversation, but right now,
<ce>                       I'll wish you good luck.

Message:  1042
<ce>                  No, I know you didn't do it, %pcf.
<ce>                    It was a =thief_ by the name of
<ce>                 _thief_. Most people in __thiefhouse_
<ce>            know %g used to be a thief, but they all think
<ce>              %g's retired to a life of public service. I
<ce>              can tell you %g hasn't. You see, %g picks a
<ce>             stranger in town to blame all %g3 burglaries
<ce>             on so %g remains above reproach. I'd love to
<ce>             see %g2 caught, but you're going to need some
<ce>               hard evidence. Most nights %g stays at a
<ce>                      place called _thiefhouse_,
<ce>             so I'd look either there or %g3 old hideout,
<ce>                     ___mondung_. Watch yourself,
<ce>                         %pcf, and good luck.

 _witness_
 told me that a noble, _noble_
 actually engineered the burglary, but, as
 %g is so far above suspicion, I'll need

 _witness_
 confessed that %g knew who committed the
 burglary and it isn't me. On the other

 are _thiefhouse_ and

 _thief_,
 a notorious but supposedly retired jewel
 thief was responsible for the burglary for
 which I've been framed, at least, according
 to _witness_. Further,
 %g says, _thief_ is now
 so well respected, I'll need hard evidence
 to convict %g2. I might be able to find
 this evidence in _thiefhouse_

 Dear _merchant_,
 
      I hope everything in __merchanthome_
 is fine and that you and your family are in good
 health. The weather, I understand, is clement,
 so I must commend you on ordering it for my
 visit.
      On to business. You mentioned in your last
 letter that you were interested in a discount
 for my services because the _gem_ is not
 of top quality and you have already found a
 convenient scapegoat for the crime. I agree to
 your terms, provided that you make certain that
 this %ra mercenary is the fool you
 suggest. If the worm turns, you know as well as
 I do, that it's every man for himself. And if
 that =priest_ _priest_
 gets involved, %g can destroy the whole affair.
      I will see you soon, my friend.

 My Darling _noble_,
 
    What a crafty, wicked thing you are. Don't
 think for a minute that I didn't suspect you
 were behind poor _qgiver_'s
 misfortune. It was very sweet of you to get
 the _gem_ I wanted, but I somehow
 thought that you were going to pay for it.
    I don't want you to think I'm unappreciative,
 my dearest darling, but if that _gem_
 is taken out of ___mondung_
 and anyone traces it to me, you won't even be
 able to count how many fingers'll be pointing
 at you. I'd watch out particularly for that
 nasty little _thief_.
 This is the sort of blackmail %g'd love.
    Nevertheless, the _gem_ was a very
 sweet thought and I thank you.
<ce>                                 Love,
<ce>                                  %n

 Dear _priest_,
 
      Ignore my last letter when I applauded you
 for your enormous contribution to ==priest_.
 That _gem_ that you said was a donation
 was stolen from _qgiver_. If
 it becomes known that the gem was stolen for our
 temple, our prestige in %reg would
 greatly suffer. _noble_ already
 hates us, and with %g3 influence on the royal
 family, ==priest_ will have
 much for which to answer.
      We will discuss at our next meeting what
 appropriate castigation this situation merits.
 Do not think of challenging the temple.
 
<ce>                          Yours Regretfully,

 My Dear _thief_,
 
    So, you're back in business, are you? When I
 heard about the affair at __qgiver_,
 I had a pleasant rush of nostalgia. Shall I ever
 fully forget the good old days when the two of us
 were partners? Surely no more than I shall forget
 when you framed me for a jewelry job in precisely
 the same way you're framing that %ra
 mercenary. That was at _merchant_'s
 business, wasn't it?
    Don't worry, this is not a blackmail note. I
 will not tell anyone a word ... unless, of course,
 they ask. Naturally, my memory may fade should you
 tell me where in ___mondung_
 you hide that _gem_.
    Please write back with your own reminiscences.
