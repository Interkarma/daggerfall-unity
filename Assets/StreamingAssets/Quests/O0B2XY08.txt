<ce>                         _qgiver_ is my name.
<ce>                      This one is a little touchy,
<ce>                        %pcf. I have _gold_ gold
<ce>                       for you if you will steal
<ce>                         some _drugs_ for me. I
<ce>                      assume you know what _drugs_
<ce>                      is? It's a highly addictive
<ce>                       herb. Do you want the job?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       If word leaks out of this
<ce>                      job, you know who I'll come
<ce>                           looking for %pcn.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                           Go to __mansion_.
<ce>                            Find _mansion_.
<ce>                           Steal the _drugs_.
<ce>                Bring it back within =traveltime_ days,
<ce>                          and you'll get paid.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Just slip them into my pocket.
<ce>                     Good. I don't think anyone saw
<ce>                     you do it. Here's your _gold_
<ce>                              gold, %pcn.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Everyone's wondering where the _drugs_ trade in __mansion_ is coming from.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
There was a _drugs_ dealer living in _mansion_ in __mansion_ but he's moved.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_mansion_ in __mansion_ was robbed, but the owner isn't going to the magistrate.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Just be casual, %pcf. The _drugs_ deal is still hot in the air.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                         %oth, %pcf. I thought
<ce>                    I could trust you to get me that
<ce>                    _drugs_. Apparently, if you want
<ce>                     a job done right, kill the %ra
<ce>                         involved first. Go to
<ce>                             Oblivion, kid.
