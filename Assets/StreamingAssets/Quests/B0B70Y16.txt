<ce>                   Shhh! Don't let anyone else hear
<ce>                         this, %pct. I just got
<ce>               word that a dragon has been spotted! Well,
<ce>                 not a full grown dragon, just a little
<ce>               dragonling. There is no quest more heroic
<ce>                 for a member of ==qgiver_ than to slay
<ce>               a dragon. I know where it is, you go kill
<ce>               it. We can both lay claim to the glory. Is
<ce>                             it a bargain?
                                     <--->
<ce>                    'Tis time for you to prove that
<ce>                      you are truly of ==qgiver_,
<ce>                      %pct. It is time for you to
<ce>                             slay a dragon.

<ce>                      You tell anyone else about
<ce>                     this and I'll see you drummed
<ce>                           out of ==qgiver_.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      The dragon egg just hatched
<ce>                        in ___dungeon_. I don't
<ce>                      know if there are any other
<ce>                       dragonlings there or not.
<ce>                       I can keep it all a secret
<ce>                           for =2dung_ days.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         All hail %pcn, known
<ce>                      from this point onward as a
<ce>                         dragonslayer! All hail
<ce>                         _qgiver_, strong right
<ce>                       arm and valued confidant!

<ce>                          ==qgiver_ for years!
