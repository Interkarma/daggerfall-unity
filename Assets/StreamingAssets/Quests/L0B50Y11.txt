<ce>                 We have an interesting job available
<ce>                       to a high ranking member
<ce>                  of the Thieves Guild. This will be
<ce>                     a tough one. Do you want it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    It's not for the faint of heart.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Understood. Come back when you are
<ce>                       interested in real work.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   You are a sharp one. The target's
<ce>                      name is _marknpc_, here in
<ce>                       ___questgiver_. %g moves
<ce>                      around a lot and is usually
<ce>                 protected by bodyguards. Be careful.
<ce>                 You have seven days. When it is done,
<ce>                 return here and I will pay you _gold_
<ce>                      gold. Ask for _questgiver_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         Excellent work %pcn.
<ce>                  I hope it wasn't too rough for you.
<ce>                        Here is your guild fee.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_marknpc_ may find trouble after all the enemies %g's made.
<--->
_marknpc_ will come to a bloody end, mark my words.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_marknpc_ has moved out of %reg, but %g'll be back.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_marknpc_ made too many mistakes -- %g was doomed long ago.
<--->
No one's surprised that _marknpc_ is dead -- %g was a troublemaker.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I haven't forgotten what you did to _marknpc_, %pcf. Don't worry about that.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                     _marknpc_ still lives, %pcf.
<ce>                'Tis not an honorable situation in any
<ce>                way, and I am not the least bit amused.

%qdt:
 I have accepted a job to assassinate
 _marknpc_ of ___questgiver_ for
 the Dark Brotherhood. My contact
 _questgiver_ told me
 that he moves around a lot. I
 have seven days to finish the job.

Message:  1015
<ce>                       _marknpc_ is still alive.
<ce>                        Don't toy with me %pcn.
<ce>                  The Dark Brotherhood does not have
<ce>                   a sense of humor. I did just hear
<ce>                      that _fakeplace_ is a false
<ce>                  address. Don't bother going there.
<ce>                   See if you can dig up other clues
<ce>                      about where %g spends time.

Message:  1020
<ce>                    _marknpc_ enjoys an occasional
<ce>                rendezvous with me. %g never stays long.
<ce>                   %g just uses me for %g3 pleasure.
<ce>                 For 50 gold I'll gladly sell %g2 out.

Message:  1021
<ce>                       Help! _marknpc_! There is
<ce>                      an assassin in the house!

Message:  1022
<ce>                      You killed _marknpc_! Just
<ce>                    let me live and I swear I won't
<ce>                         tell them who did it.

Message:  1023
<ce>                     _marknpc_ comes here every day
<ce>                   at around 6 o'clock. %g sends %g3
<ce>                   bodyguards away. %g is only here
<ce>                          for an hour or so.

Message:  1030
<ce>                 _marknpc_ is a thief and a scoundrel.
                                     <--->
<ce>  Everyone thinks _marknpc_ hangs out at _fakeplace_, but %g doesn't.
                                     <--->
<ce>            _marknpc_ usually spends %g3 evenings at _inn_.
                                     <--->
<ce>            _marknpc_ spends %g3 mornings sleeping at home.
                                     <--->
<ce>   _marknpc_ lives at _house_, but %g doesn't spend much time there.
                                     <--->
<ce>       In the afternoons, _marknpc_ can be found at _guildhall_.
                                     <--->
<ce>  I've heard that _guildhall_ is a Thieves Guild hangout. Try there.
                                     <--->
<ce>                       _marknpc_ has a mistress.
                                     <--->
<ce>             _marknpc_'s mistress lives at _mistresshome_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  _marknpc_ has a lot of bodyguards.
                                     <--->
<ce>   When _marknpc_ visits %g3 mistress, %g sends %g3 bodyguards away.
                                     <--->
<ce>            I wouldn't tangle with _marknpc_'s bodyguards.
                                     <--->
<ce>              They say _marknpc_ is protected by spells.

Message:  1031
<ce>                 _marknpc_ falls to the ground, dead.
<ce>                    The Brotherhood will be proud.
