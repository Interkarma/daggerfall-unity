QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                        I don't trust you, %pcn.
<ce>                      You are not a member of our
<ce>                    order. If you would like to earn
<ce>                   my trust, and maybe even a modicum
<ce>                   of respect, go kill the _monster_
<ce>                  raiding the farms. Are you up to it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     I thought so. The heart of a
<ce>                    coward beats within your chest.
<ce>                     The sight of you makes me ill.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  The _monster_ has made its lair in
<ce>                       ___dungeon_. Go there and
<ce>                      kill it. There may be other
<ce>                  _monster_s there, but I don't care.
<ce>                   I am only interested in one with a
<ce>                 large burn mark on its back. It's the
<ce>                one that has been raiding the peasants.
<ce>                         You have =2dung_ days.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      Hmmph. You did better than
<ce>                     expected, %pcn. Maybe someday
<ce>                      you will even be worthy of a
<ce>                   membership in the knightly order.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That _monster_ is a real nuisance in ___qgiver_.
<--->
Many wish the knights would do something about that _monster_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Thank %god, and not the knightly order, the _monster_ moved on.
<--->
It's only natural that the _monster_ moved. But it'll return.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Everyone is thanking the knights for slaying that _monster_.
<--->
No one expected the knightly order to do anything about the _monster_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Awright, kid. After what you did, I can be civil to you.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
_monster_ Lover, get outta here.
<--->
You make me sick, _monster_ Lover.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 the knightly order in ___qgiver_
 told me of a _monster_ that needs
 slaying in ___dungeon_.
 I only have =2dung_ days.

Message:  1011
<ce>                        On it's back is a large
<ce>                      scorched area. This must be
<ce>                       the one _qgiver_ spoke of.
