<ce>                       Normally I would not give
<ce>                         work to someone not a
<ce>                          member of __qgiver_.
<ce>                      However, we are short handed
<ce>                       right now. A brazen thief
<ce>                          stole a _religitem_
<ce>                       from the temple. A priest
<ce>                    got a good look at the criminal.
<ce>                    It was a common street thief, a
<ce>                         =thief_ named _thief_
<ce>                   who was in the temple on that day,
<ce>                         pretending to worship.
<ce>                  Track down this thief and return our
<ce>                     stolen _religitem_, and I will
<ce>                    speak well of you in the future.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      I give you a chance and you
<ce>                      spit in my face. Don't come
<ce>                       looking to me for favors.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                        You need to get it back
<ce>                       within =traveltime_ days.
<ce>                       By then our knightly order
<ce>                        will be able to dispatch
<ce>                      a search party and you will
<ce>                         have lost your chance.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       All praises to you, %pcn.
<ce>                          The _religitem_ has
<ce>                      been restored to the temple.
<ce>                       You have earned the favor
<ce>                                of %god.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>     _thief_ is holed up in _thiefplace_ in __thiefplace_.  A good
<ce>                     place to hide from __qgiver_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
__qgiver_ will never get that _religitem_ back it seems.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_thief_ was brought to justice, and __qgiver_ got their _religitem_ back.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Don't think that I forgot who brought us our _religitem_ already, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Our _religitem_ is lost forever and you want to talk. Unbelievable.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_, of __qgiver_
 in ___qgiver_, has given me
 the chance to find the _religitem_
 which had been stolen by a
 =thief_ named _thief_.
 I have =traveltime_ days to get it back.

<ce>                       %oth!  The temple hired a
<ce>                       bounty hunter just to get
<ce>                   back their worthless _religitem_?
<ce>                       %oth, it sure ain't worth
<ce>                      dying over.  Here, take it.
<ce>                      Now, we'll see if you think
<ce>                        it's worth dying over...
<ce>                       Help!!  This %ra is making
<ce>                           off with our loot!

Message:  1012
<ce>                      Intruder! Raise the alarm!
<ce>                      There is an intruder in the
<ce>                               building!

Message:  1013
<ce>      _thief_... The name sounds familiar, but I can't place it.
<ce>     I'm thinking maybe someone I ran into in __thiefplace_?  Sorry
<ce>                        I can't be more helpful.
                                     <--->
<ce>          A =decoy_?  Sure, I know %g2.  Lives in ___decoy_.
                                     <--->
<ce>   If you're talking about a =thief_, %g sounds like a little weasel
<ce>          from __thiefplace_ who tried to pick my pocket once.

Message:  1014
<ce>  Sure, I know that squirrelly little sneak.  Check out _thiefplace_
 in __thiefplace_.
<ce>                                   
<ce> _thief_?  Yeah, %g's "laying low" over at _thiefplace_ in __thiefplace_.
<ce> Not keeping too low a profile though, since you and I know where %g is!

Message:  1020
<ce>                  _thief_ tosses you the _religitem_,
<ce>                    then vanishes into the shadows.
<ce>                        Now to make your escape!
