<ce>                           %pcf, we have an
<ce>               emergency. The Mages Guild has discovered
<ce>                a rift in the wall between Oblivion and
<ce>               our dimension, Mundus. I don't pretend to
<ce>                understand exactly what that means, but
<ce>               it's bad. All sorts of Daedric beings are
<ce>                entering into our world. The Mages Guild
<ce>               says it can seal the breach, but it falls
<ce>                  to us to slay the Daedras that have
<ce>                  already crossed over. Will you take
<ce>                      up this quest, not for gold,
<ce>                             but for glory?
                                     <--->
<ce>                         The end, %pct, may be
<ce>                 here at last. For centuries, prophets
<ce>                    have spoken of the day when the
<ce>                   aetherial walls that separate our
<ce>                 dimension, Mundus, from Oblivion, the
<ce>                land of the Daedra, will crack asunder.
<ce>                 The Mages Guild will attempt to repair
<ce>                the breach, but they need us to slay the
<ce>                  infernal creatures who have already
<ce>                   broken through. Can we rely on you
<ce>                            for this, %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        Our world hangs in the
<ce>                       balance and you can think
<ce>                         only of yourself. I am
<ce>                       ashamed to know you are a
<ce>                               ==qgiver_.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Go quickly then to ___dungeon_.
<ce>                     We have no way of knowing how
<ce>                     many Daedra are wandering its
<ce>                     halls. The Mages Guild says to
<ce>                      slay all Daedric beings you
<ce>                      encounter. They will contact
<ce>                     you by spell when they detect
<ce>                     the last invader gone. Hurry,
<ce>                      for in =2dung_ days it will
<ce>                              be too late.

<ce>                So you killed the Daedra eh? Actually,
<ce>                 this is kind of embarrassing. It turns
<ce>                   out that we were duped by a rogue
<ce>                  mage. She had summoned a Daedra that
<ce>                 she could not control and wanted us to
<ce>                  slay it before the Guild found out.
<ce>                   She thought that with her story we
<ce>                would do it for free rather than having
<ce>                to pay the Fighters Guild. Normally our
<ce>                   order does not pay its members for
<ce>                   their trouble. This is an unusual
<ce>               situation. Take these _gold_ gold pieces.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
If the people of %reg knew what the Mages Guild knows, everyone'd riot.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
No thanks to %kno, the end of Tamriel was narrowly averted.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The Mages Guild owes %kno for that fiasco over in ___dungeon_, so I hear.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Well, %pcf, as you sort of saved the world, what can I do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
All of Tamriel was nearly destroyed, %pcf. And I'm a little annoyed with you.
<--->
I don't think you can blame me for not trusting you after your last debacle.

%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 ==qgiver_ in ___qgiver_
 says that Daedras are pouring
 through a dimensional rift.
 I must go to ___dungeon_
 and kill them all. They will
 contact me by spell when I
 have slain the last of them.
 I have =2dung_ days before it
 is too late.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      A voice from beyond echoes
<ce>                        in your head, saying...
<ce>                                    
<ce>                       "The last Daedra is dead.
<ce>                        With it dead, Tamriel is
<ce>                        safe again. Hey what are
<ce>                        you doing! Let go of my
<ce>                        arms! I am a guild mage!
<ce>                        Don't blow out that..."
