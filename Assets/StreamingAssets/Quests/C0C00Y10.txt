<ce>                   The best way to get in good with
<ce>                   the temple is to heal someone. I
<ce>                   know of a case that might do the
<ce>                         trick for you, %pcn.
<ce>                           Are you willing?
                                     <--->
<ce>                           I am _giver_. You
<ce>                     aren't high in the hierarchy
<ce>                             of __giver_.
<ce>                       I might be able to speak
<ce>                    favorably of you if you were to
<ce>                  find a way to cure someone I know.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     If you aren't even willing or
<ce>                    able to do a simple healing, I
<ce>                     surely can't recommend you to
<ce>                            temple leaders.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                        _cousin_ in ___cousin_
<ce>                  suffering from an unusual disease.
<ce>                   I was about to dispatch a cleric
<ce>                   to treat %g2. I will delay them a
<ce>                   day or so. If you can find a cure
<ce>                   it would increase your favor with
<ce>                         __giver_. I can only
<ce>                      give you =questtime_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
%qdt:
 I have been given the chance by
 _giver_ of __giver_
 in ___giver_ to heal
 _cousin_ of ___cousin_.
 If I do not have %g2 healed in =questtime_ days
 someone else will be sent to do the
 job instead.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                            _cousin_ looks
<ce>                        much healthier to you.
<ce>                        Obviously, %g is cured.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Poor _cousin_. How that =cousin_ suffers!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_giver_ of __giver_ is plenty furious with that %ra.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
That _cousin_ who was cured was _giver_ of __giver_'s cousin.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I have heard that _cousin_ was cured. %god bless thee, %pcf. What do you need?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
_cousin_ has died, and I blame thee, %pcf.

Message:  1025
<ce>                  I'll be watching you. Remember, the
<ce>                    patient's name is _cousin_ and
<ce>                     %g is in ___cousin_. You have
<ce>                  =questtime_ days to prove yourself.

<ce>                     I feel so weak. I don't know
<ce>                 what is wrong with me. Have you come
<ce>             to help me? Yes? Do you have the cure? If so,
<ce>               please use it on me, so that I may heal.

Message:  1011
<ce>                          Wilt thou do this?

Message:  1012
I heard about %g3 disease. Some say that _healer_ of ___healer_ has a cure.
<--->
I did hear something of %g2. Something about a disease and someone named _healer_ in ___healer_ who had a cure.

Message:  1013
<ce>                   Hello there. Yes, I have heard of
<ce>                    _cousin_ of ___cousin_ and %g3
<ce>                    problem. Caliron's Curse it is.
<ce>                    Often mistaken for Gray Fever.
<ce>                     Anyway, I do have a some Hoar
<ce>                     Frost Root that will cure it.
<ce>                   It can only be used once though.
<ce>                   I'll sell it to you for 20 gold.

Message:  1014
<ce>                Do you wish to buy the Hoar Frost Root?

Message:  1015
<ce>                   I'm sorry, you don't seem to have
<ce>                  enough gold for the Hoar Frost Root.

Message:  1016
<ce>           Thank you, %pcn. I will use the Hoar Frost Root.
<ce>                I really can't thank you enough. I hope
<ce>              the rest of your travels are safe for you.

Message:  1017
%qdt:
 I have bought some Hoar Frost Root
 from _healer_ of ___healer_
 that cures Caliron's Curse, the
 disease that is inflicting _cousin_.

Message:  1018
%qdt:
 I have given Hoar Frost Root to _cousin_
 and cured %g2 of the Caliron's Curse.
 Maybe now __giver_ will think
 more highly of me.

Message:  1019
<ce>                 The Hoar Frost Root dissolves quickly
<ce>                            as you use it.
