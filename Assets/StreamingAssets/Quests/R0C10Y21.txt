<ce>                        My cousin, _qgfriend_,
<ce>                 has appealed to me for aid in a rather
<ce>                 distasteful situation. It appears that
<ce>                 there is a ... temple of some variety
<ce>                being consecrated, if that's the proper
<ce>                   phrase for these disgusting orcish
<ce>                  activities. Well, obviously, we need
<ce>                  to crush it while it's budding. I am
<ce>                willing to go as high as _reward_ gold.
<ce>                    Can I count on your help, %pcf?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      What are you, some kind of
<ce>                      orc-friend? %oth, get out of
<ce>                               my sight!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Thank you in advance for this, %pcf.
<ce>                 What I think would be the best use of
<ce>              your abilities is to infiltrate ___mondung_
<ce>           and eliminate the so-called shaman of the temple.
<ce>                  If we can kill it before our assault
<ce>              in =1stparton_ days that would make our job
<ce>               much easier. When the deed is done, report
<ce>                 to my cousin's palace in ___qgfriend_.
<ce>                  %g's the one who's going to pay you
<ce>                             for all this.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                Better get on the road to ___mondung_,
<ce>               %pcf.  The plan is already in motion, and
<ce>                         we're counting on you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Greetings to you, %pcf. First
<ce>                  rate job with that stinking, rancid
<ce>                  shaman. How dare they set up one of
<ce>                   their cannibal temples in my land!
<ce>                    The leaderless rabble should be
<ce>                  easier to deal with now. Here's your
<ce>                     _reward_ gold pieces. Go wild.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There's an orc community in ___mondung_ that's been bothering _qgfriend_.
<--->
___mondung_ was, I think, an orc temple years ago. Now they're bringing it back.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That whole orcish community got a whiff of _qgfriend_ and it's moved on.
<--->
Poor _qgfriend_ didn't get to exact his revenge on the orcs in ___mondung_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
That'll teach those pig-faced degenerate cannibals to come to %reg.
<--->
%god bless _qgfriend_ and _questgiver_ and that unknown %ra soldier.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Heard any good orc jokes lately? My cousin told me what a good job you did.
<--->
My cousin was mightily impressed with your work on that orc shaman, my friend.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                       My cousin says you didn't
<ce>                    kill that orc shaman after all.
<ce>                     I'm not interested in speaking
<ce>                        on the subject anymore.

Message:  1011
=qgfriend_, yes? A possible ally of _questgiver_ with a problem with orcs.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is a violent bigot when it comes to orcs.

Message:  1012
<ce>                    You have killed the orc shaman.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 I have =1stparton_ days to slay an orc shaman
 in ___mondung_, and then get to _qgfriend_'s
 palace in ___qgfriend_.  %g
 will pay me my _reward_ gold pieces
 for the shaman's death.
