<ce>                       %pcf, the Princess _lady_
<ce>                 has been captured from our protection,
<ce>                   and it is the responsibility of us
<ce>                 knights to rescue her. Unfortunately,
<ce>                  many of our members are off fighting
<ce>                  in the war. In the truest spirit of
<ce>                  chivalry, will you go to rescue the
<ce>                  princess from the _monster_ who has
<ce>                             captured her?
                                     <--->
<ce>                    The war has busied the order to
<ce>                  such a degree that important duties
<ce>                  such as protecting the virtue of the
<ce>                         noblewomen of %reg has
<ce>                  fallen rather by the wayside. There
<ce>                    is literally no one available to
<ce>                         rescue Princess _lady_
<ce>                   who was carried off the other day.
<ce>                       Are you free for this most
<ce>                           worthy of quests?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Ah, that is not the spirit of our
<ce>                 order. There is nothing more important
<ce>                    to us than protecting the virtue
<ce>                            of the innocent.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  You will? I must say, your heart is
<ce>                brave. A _monster_ is a fearsome foe. Be
<ce>                certain to prepare for a battle. Do not
<ce>                  be foolhardy -- we care only for the
<ce>                rescue of the princess. If the _monster_
<ce>                  can be left alone, leave him. And if
<ce>              you are not returned in =2mondung_ days, we
<ce>                 will assume that you have failed, and
<ce>                  someone will be sent in your place.
<ce>                  I am certain you do not want someone
<ce>                 else to earn the honor of the rescue.
<ce>                      May %god bless your journey
<ce>                            to ___mondung_.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                         Hurry, %pcf. You only
<ce>                       have =2mondung_ days left.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      Princess _lady_, may I more
<ce>                 officially introduce you to your good
<ce>                             rescuer, %pcn.
<ce>                You have done a fine and honorable thing
<ce>                 this day, my friend, and it shall not
<ce>                             be forgotten.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Greetings, %pct. You'll be happy to know that Lady _lady_ is doing well.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
What a fiasco that Lady _lady_ affair was. I imagine you want it behind you.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of __qgiver_
 in ___qgiver_ has given me a quest
 to rescue the fair Lady _lady_
 from ___mondung_, where she
 has been captured and imprisoned by a _monster_.
 I have =2mondung_ days to rescue her before someone
 else is sent to win my honor and glory.

Message:  1011
<ce>             A small, thin, pale little boy hisses at you
<ce>              and slips a note into your hand. He vanishes
<ce>                   almost the moment you notice him.

Message:  1012
<ce>                  You have just slain the _monster_,
<ce>                   the stuff of _lady_'s nightmares.

Message:  1013
<ce>                        Lady _lady_ leaves you,
<ce>                   intent on making her own way home.

Message:  1014
Dear %pcf,
 
      If you were hesitating in that quest out of
 reasonable fear that your dear friends, the _monster_s
 of %reg would not want you to foil the
 rather lascivious plans of one of its order, do not
 fear. =monster_ is about
 as precious to our cold hearts as a puddle of month
 old spew.
      Enjoy yourself. And, if you are so inclined,
 enjoy _lady_.
 
<ce>                           Your Dear Friends,
<ce>                        The Oldest Power in %reg

Message:  1015
<ce>                       "You're %pcf! Thank %god!
<ce>                            I'm Lady _lady_,
<ce>                      let's get out of here now."
