QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  How would you like to have a lovely
<ce>                    _reward_ from my treasury, %pcf?
<ce>                  My alchemist has ordered a very rare
<ce>                  ingredient he needs for an important
<ce>                   experiment and we need someone to
<ce>                   pick it up. Do you think you could
<ce>                           handle that, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Well, that's odd. You might
<ce>                   try not to have such a mercenary's
<ce>                              heart, %pcf.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                        Excellent, %pcf, I knew
<ce>                      you would be game. Take this
<ce>                       _item1_ down to __contact_
<ce>                        in ___contact_. There's
<ce>                           a =contact_ there
<ce>                       by the name of _contact_.
<ce>                    Ask %g2 to give you the _item2_
<ce>                        %g's brought up from the
<ce>                   south. Make sure you're there and
<ce>                  back in =1stparton_ days. All righty
<ce>                        then, %pcf. I'm relying
<ce>                           on you. Don't make
<ce>                             me regret it.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                          The _item2_, %pcf?
<ce>                      Remember? And don't dawdle.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Good timing, %pcf. My alchemist
<ce>                   will be so pleased -- it is a most
<ce>                   excellent _item2_. As I promised,
<ce>                         here is your _reward_.
<ce>                           Pretty, isn't it?

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_'s alchemist once refused a chip of ebonium -- it wasn't "fresh".
<--->
_questgiver_'s alchemist always requires very fresh elements. Don't know why.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_questgiver_ is having trouble with %g3 alchemist. Very temperamental, I hear.
<--->
A whole batch of _questgiver_'s alchemist's potions had to be thrown away.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Really strange smells coming out of _questgiver_'s palace lately, you notice?
<--->
I saw this puff of red smoke rise out of _questgiver_'s palace like a bird.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Don't think for a minute I've forgotten you, %pcf. How are you, friend?
<--->
My alchemist wanted to thank you personally, %pcf, but he's busy. How are you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    If my alchemist were here, he'd
<ce>                         demand the _item2_ you
<ce>                  were to retrieve, and then brain you
<ce>                    with it. But, as it is, consider
<ce>                      this a warning. Do not fail
<ce>                       me in the future, should I
<ce>                          need your services.
<ce>                              That is all.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                      And you must be %pcf, sent
<ce>                         by _questgiver_, yes?
<ce>                      Well, here's that _item2_ %g
<ce>                   wanted. You better hurry back with
<ce>                  it -- %g3 alchemist has very strong
<ce>                    feelings about the freshness of
<ce>                   ingredients. Misplaced, of course.
<ce>                     _item2_ doesn't spoil. Still,
<ce>                    you know what they say about one
<ce>                   man's poison ... Now hurry along.
