QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 My name is _qgiver_. I have a mission
<ce>         that requires the utmost stealth and secrecy. The risk
<ce>         is minimal, and I will pay you _gold_ gold pieces. It
<ce>        will only take =traveltime_ days of your time. I cannot
<ce>             tell you more unless you accept this mission.
                                     <--->
<ce>            Hullo there, young %ra. How'd you like to make
<ce>          _gold_ gold pieces just by performing what I'm told
<ce>          is called in mercenary circles "the old switcheroo"?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>           I understand. I am glad that I did not reveal any
<ce>               details to you. Now you cannot betray me.
                                     <--->
<ce>           Very well, but lack of ambition may well be your
<ce>                       downfall, my young friend.


AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                        Go to _inn_ in __inn_.
<ce>            Lodged there is a courier bearing a letter, take
<ce>            it and leave this false one in its place. Do not
<ce>             disturb any of his belongings. If he finds out
<ce>              that the letter has been switched, all of my
<ce>             plans will be ruined. If you are caught don't
<ce>                       bother trying to find me.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Don't you have a letter to 'deliver' for me?
                                     <--->
<ce>         Come back when you have completed your mission, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               Ah! Well done, %pcf. Here is your reward.
<ce>            Never mention this affair to anyone. I will deny
<ce>                           ever meeting you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                The harvest looks to be good this year.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>               _qgiver_ has fallen on hard times lately.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>            _qgiver_ has run into a string of luck lately.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>           Shhh. I certainly do remember that little letter
<ce>             switching mission you ran for me, but I would
<ce>                 rather that nobody else knew about it.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>              It's you! All I asked was that you switch a
<ce>             simple letter, and you could not even do that!
<ce>                           Leave my presence.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 I met secretly with _qgiver_ in
 ___qgiver_ who gave me a
 falsified letter. I am to sneak into the
 _inn_ in __inn_ and
 replace the true letter. I have =traveltime_ days
 to complete this quest. If I am caught,
 I am on my own.

Message:  1011
_npc1_,
    You are a most spiteful man. How could I ever
 have thought that I loved you. Since you caught me
 on the balcony in the arms of _npc2_,
 I can now reveal that we are indeed lovers. %g is
 able to give me everything that you cannot. You made
 me feel unclean with your disgusting gifts of gold.
 Do not ever darken my doorway again.
 
                       _npc3_

Message:  1012
My dearest _npc1_,
    I know you are angry and hurt. I would do
 anything to regain your love. What you saw on the
 balcony was not of my desire. I had too much to drink
 that night and _npc2_ took advantage of
 the moment to steal a kiss. %g has been flogged and
 is no longer in my service. Please forgive me.
 I love only you.
 
                       _npc3_

Message:  1013
<ce>          This tavern looks like any other. However, for you
<ce>             it a place where stealth counts for more than
<ce>            strength. Now to find out where the courier has
<ce>                           left that letter.

Message:  1014
<ce>       Thief! I'll teach you to steal from an honest messenger!

Message:  1015
<ce>            As the letter full of lies leaves your fingers,
<ce>                 you know that your quest is half done.

Message:  1016
Baron _npc1_,
    Count _npc2_ will have %g3 forces
 waiting to ambush you in the pass. Do not
 fall for his trap.
                     _npc3_

Message:  1017
_npc1_,
    Your offer is ludicrous!
 I can buy at half that price
 from any other merchant in
 ___npc1_, and I will.
                  _npc2_

Message:  1018
Honorable _npc1_,
    I have decided to cast my
 vote for you when the guild
 ballots for treasurer. Of
 course I expect to be treated
 well in the near future.
                   _npc2_

Message:  1019
Baron _npc1_,
    Count _npc2_ will be
 waiting for you in the pass.
 %g3 truce agreement is an
 honorable and fair one.
                  _npc3_

Message:  1020
_npc1_,
    Your price is a fair one.
 This letter is my bond of
 payment for the goods. Present
 it to my factor when you
 deliver them.
                  _npc2_

Message:  1021
Honorable _npc1_,
    I have decided to cast my
 vote for _npc3_ at the
 next guild meeting. %g has
 shown %g3 faithfulness to
 the guild many times.
                  _npc2_

Message:  1022
<ce>  You were caught and you know it.
<ce>  Get out of my sight, %ra.

Message:  1030
<ce>                      _qgiver_ is a real weasel.

Message:  1031
<ce>                      _qgiver_ seems nice enough,
<ce>                  but I wouldn't play cards with %g2.
