QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  Welcome to Sentinel, %pcf. I guess
<ce>         you must have received my letter. I know some things
<ce>        about Lysandus and why he might be haunting Daggerfall,
<ce>           but before I tell you, you have to promise to do
<ce>              something for me first. Is that all right?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                         %oth, %pcf, I thought
<ce>                 you were a hero. I guess I was wrong.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               You will? Thank %god. You see, I used to
<ce>          have an older brother, ten or eleven years older
<ce>        than me, named _brother_. Whenever I ask what happened
<ce>          to him, I'm told a different story. Some say he got
<ce>            sick and died, some say he was kidnapped by the
<ce>         Underking. I want to know the truth. If you can find
<ce>         some proof of what really happened to him, I'll tell
<ce>                  you all I know about King Lysandus.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    I wanted some real proof, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             This is what I most feared. Poor _brother_. As I
<ce>                promised, here's what I've heard about
<ce>              Lysandus. I don't know how much of this is
<ce>             secret, but I trust you. Lysandus was in love
<ce>             with his court sorceress, a noblewoman named
<ce>              Medora Direnni, and during the war with us,
<ce>             his queen found out. They say that while her
<ce>               husband was gone, Queen Mynisera banished
<ce>              Medora from the court. My sister Aubk-i is
<ce>            queen now, part of the treaty to ensure peace,
<ce>            but Mynisera still resides at Castle Daggerfall
<ce>                     as the dowager Queen mother.
<ce>                                    
<ce>              I don't know where Medora went, but I know
<ce>              she has an enormous castle somewhere on the
<ce>              Isle of Balfiera. But I also heard there is
<ce>             some kind of curse on her, and she can never
<ce>              leave. I don't know if that helps you, but
<ce>                that's all I know. Again, thank you for
<ce>            _brother_'s letter. Just knowing what happened
<ce>             will ease my heart somewhat. Please take this
<ce>              _magicitem_ as a token of my appreciation.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Poor Prince Lhotun is in one of his moods. He's so different from Greklith.
<--->
Queen Akorithi doesn't know what to do with Prince Lhotun. He's so gloomy.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Prince Lhotun's black moods always lift eventually. Strange for a boy his age.
<--->
Prince Lhotun seems to be in an even darker mood than ever. Very odd boy.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Prince Lhotun's mood has gotten better. He's still quiet, but that's normal.
<--->
Queen Akorithi happily reports that her youngest is back in good spirits again.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hello, %pct. I'm sorry. I'm still shaken from reading my brother's journal.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    So you haven't any information
<ce>                  for me? I must say, it seems highly
<ce>                  suspicious that there is nothing to
<ce>                  report. Perhaps you're working for
<ce>                   my mother or one of the nobles. I
<ce>                      think you should leave now.

 ___ukcrypt_
 
 Two days I was sealed within this crypt without food or
 water. I do not know whether hunger or poor health or
 one of the creatures who share this dank hole with me
 will kill me first -- I only know that I will soon be
 dead, and not even my bones will remain. My hope is that
 in the years that come, this letter will be read and the
 sad story of _brother_, Prince of Sentinel will be told.
 
 I am fifteen years old at the time of this writing, and
 have been plagued with bad health for most of my life,
 to the frustration of my hearty parents. The finest
 healers and apothecaries in western Tamriel have labored
 over my every cough and fever, but while they could save
 my life time and time again, they could not improve my
 sickly constitution. In retrospect, I received little
 real affection from the king and queen, embarrassed as
 they were about begetting such a cripple as the heir of
 the kingdom. I cannot say I missed the love; I received
 much attention from the doctors, priests, and herbalists
 constantly at court. Certainly I was not to be the sort
 of warrior that King Camaron was, but one of my dearest
 friends, a priest of Stendarr said that I might be the
 first scholar-king in the history of Sentinel.
 
 My younger sister Aubk-i was the true favorite of my
 parents: athletic, beautiful, and charming. It is hard to
 think of an uncomplimentary word for her. I am resigned
 to my imminent death, and yet, I would like to see her
 once again. For six years, Aubk-i and I were the only
 children of Sentinel. Eight years ago, the queen had a
 boy child and named him Greklith, after the ancient
 Redguard word for Strong King. Few speak that tongue
 any longer, but all the scholars and nobles of Hammerfell
 understood. And Greklith is a strong boy indeed -- I have
 never so much as seen him cough. The Queen's next child,
 born only a year after Greklith, had an even more ominous
 birthname -- Lhotun. Second Boy. Perhaps had I been less
 sheltered, more suspicious by nature, I might have read
 into these nominations. Lhotun and Greklith are common
 enough names in our family, I reasoned. Now I know that
 even then, I was disinherited -- even if it was
 not official yet.
 
 For several months before Lhotun's birth and over three
 years afterward, I was in the throes of a very serious
 fever. The doctors despaired of me, but somehow and very,
 very gradually, I recovered. For the first time, and the
 last, I read an expression on my father, the King's face
 that was not indifference. It was disgust.
 
 That was a fortnight ago. Three nights ago, I was seized
 by men I had never seen while I was having a walk. My
 nursemaid stood by watching placidly as I was gagged
 and tied and thrown roughly into a sack. I do not know
 how long they rode with me, but I was eventually left
 here. When I finally freed myself from my bonds, I found
 that I was alone. My wanders have gotten me nowhere.
 This place is filled with undead creatures that prevent
 me from finding any exit.
 
 I have no hope left, but no fear either. A few regrets.
 Perhaps had I studied magic instead of history and
 science I could free myself of this place. One of my
 tutors told the story of the Underking, how he had
 placed his lifeforce in the body of a powerful being
 and had thus conquered all Tamriel long, long ago.
 Had I only had the strength of a more powerful body
 like that.
 
 But I did not study magic. I studied history, so I
 leave this letter -- not to revenge myself, but as
 an historic document.

<ce>            A thin, rail of a woman steps forward and hands
<ce>            you a note. She turns aside all your questions
<ce>                  with a gaunt, expressionless face.

Message:  1012
The Underking used to have a crypt around here -- ___ukcrypt_, just %di of here.
<--->
No one has heard much of the Underking since his crypt ___ukcrypt_ was abandoned.
<--->
King Camaron himself drove the Underking's servants out of ___ukcrypt_.

Message:  1013
The Underking is supposed to be centuries old.
<--->
That other king is a buffoon. Oh...UNDERking! Sorry, I don't know anything about that.
<--->
He is a lich of great power. So they say.
<--->
I heard he kidnapped Prince _brother_.
<--->
King Camaron blamed the Underking for Prince _brother_'s death. Never made sense to me though.
<--->
They say Tiber Septim never really died. He became the Underking.
<--->
Aw, he's just some boogey man, you know, like Jagar Tharn.
<--->
The Underking is just a child's myth.
<--->
Underking? Never heard of him.

 Dear %pcn,
 
     You do not know me but I know you. I know that you were
 shipwrecked. I know that you are trying to dispell the ghost
 of King Lisandus. If you want, I can tell you what I know,
 but I need your help in return.
     If you want to talk, my name is Prince Lhotun and I live
 in Sentinel at Samaruik, which is usually called Castle
 Sentinel. I hope that we can meet soon.
 
 
<ce>                             Yours truly,
 
<ce>                                Lhotun,
<ce>                          Prince of Sentinel

Message:  1015
___ukcrypt_ used to be the Underking's crypt, but now it's a Sentilian prison.
<--->
___ukcrypt_ is just %di of here. Some say it's still a crypt of the Underking.

Message:  1016
___ukcrypt_ is directly %di of here. It used to be a crypt of the Underking.
<--->
___ukcrypt_ isn't used as a prison anymore, let alone a crypt of the Underking.

Message:  1018
<ce>            What is the meaning of this? Blackmail? Why you
<ce>           contemptible scoundrel. You ought to be thrashed
<ce>            for attempting to pass this cheap counterfeit.
<ce>           Poor Prince _brother_ died of a fever many, many
<ce>            years ago. Why can't you let him rest in peace?

Message:  1019
%qdt:
 Prince Lhotun of Sentinel has asked
 me to investigate the death of his
 brother, _brother_, who was supposedly
 kidnapped by the Underking years ago.

Message:  1020
<ce>                You pick up a death certificate.

Message:  1030
_brother_ was a prince of Sentinel. He died years ago.
<--->
_brother_ came down with a fever and eventually died.
<--->
Wasn't he the scholar prince?
<--->
_brother_ liked books more than swords. It used to drive King Camaron crazy.
<--->
He was the only prince never to receive a public funeral.

Message:  1031
<ce> Old King Camaron, may his soul rest in peace, never liked _brother_.
 He would have preferred Greklith to be his heir.
                                     <--->
I heard that _brother_'s former nursemaid was sent to Skyrim with a chest full of gold. 
<--->
King Camaron seemed far too happy when _brother_ died.
<--->
I heard he died of a fever.
<--->
I always wondered about _brother_. The King refused to let the temple prepare the body for burial.

Message:  1032
Dear %pcf,
 
 If you are interested in learning the truth,
 about prince _brother_, meet me at
 _agentplace_ in __agentplace_ of Sentinel.
 
<ce>                              (unsigned)

Message:  1035
<ce>                    %pcn? Shhh. I would prefer that
<ce>             nobody sees me talking with you. It has come
<ce>             to our attention that the Underking is being
<ce>                  wrongly accused of abducting prince
<ce>                _brother_. Before you judge, check into
<ce>                   ___ukcrypt_. I'll mark it on your
<ce>                  map. Who am I? Just call me a loyal
<ce>                 servant. Now move away before anyone
<ce>                    gets suspicious. Go on, scram.

Message:  1040
%qdt:
 I met secretly with an agent of the Underking.
 Supposedly the Underking had nothing to do with
 the abduction of _brother_. I am supposed
 to check out ___ukcrypt_.
