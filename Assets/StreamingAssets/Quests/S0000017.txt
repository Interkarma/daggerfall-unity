<ce>                      %pcn! Welcome to Sentinel.
<ce>                  I trust you have had a comfortable
<ce>                 stay so far. Let me get right to the
<ce>                  point. My son, Prince Lhotun, says
<ce>                 you are a well respected and trusted
<ce>                    %ra. I have need of your sort.
<ce>                  I am willing to pay you _gold_ gold
<ce>                   to infiltrate Castle Wayrest and
<ce>                    recover an heirloom of the late
<ce>                 King Lysandus for me. Will you do it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Hmmm. I shall have to rethink your
<ce>                        standing in this court.

<ce>                   What Bounty! There is an item, a
<ce>                  painting, that is hidden somewhere
<ce>                    within Castle Wayrest. I desire
<ce>                  this item for reasons you need not
<ce>                   worry about. Bring it to me and I
<ce>                      will pay your _gold_ gold.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Here is your _gold_ gold %pcf.

 Queen Akorithi has set me to infiltrate
 Castle Wayrest. Somewhere in its
 dungeons is a painting that she
 desires. If I can place it in her hands,
 she will pay me _gold_ gold.

Message:  1011
Dear %pcn,
 
 Your presence in our court is desired
 before the end of the next season.
 Prince Lhotun has recommended you with
 high praise. I await your arrival.
 
<ce>                               Akorithi
<ce>                           Queen of Sentinel

Message:  1012
<ce>               A page girl bearing the crest of Sentinel
<ce>                stiffly presents you a crisply pressed
<ce>              envelope. Ignoring your queries, she turns
<ce>                            and walks away.

Message:  1013
<ce>               The longer you stare, the more the image
<ce>                  in the painting seems to be moving.
<ce>                You tear your eyes away before anything
<ce>                        worse begins to happen.

Message:  1015
<ce>                 The scene in the painting shifts and
<ce>                twists. You can clearly see the inside
<ce>                of a tent. Several men in the livery of
<ce>                 Wayrest are intensely debating with a
<ce>              man bearing the coat of arms of Daggerfall.
<ce>                One of the Wayrest men slips behind the
<ce>                  Daggerfall man, draws a dagger and
<ce>                 casually slides it between his ribs.
<ce>                 The image fades as the life ebbs from
<ce>                               his body.

Message:  1020
<ce>                 Did you attempt to use the painting?

Message:  1021
<ce>                     Excellent. Its properties are
<ce>                 inappropriate for those not of royal
<ce>                 blood. You have shown yourself to be
<ce>                  not only loyal, but also obedient.

Message:  1022
<ce>                        You presume much %pcn.
<ce>                  What you saw is not for the prying
<ce>                    eyes of the masses. It concerns
<ce>                 matters of royalty and will be dealt
<ce>                           with by royalty.
