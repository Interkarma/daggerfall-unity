QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 Hey, if I told you I could give you a
<ce>                 bit of information, let's say, about
<ce>                  that letter of milady, would you be
<ce>                   innerested there, %pcf? I thought
<ce>                   so. Now, mind you, I ain't givin'
<ce>                  it away. Before I scratch yer back,
<ce>                     you gotta scratch mine. Deal?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Of course not. You only do work for
<ce>                  the likes of kings, don't ya? Poor
<ce>                 Cyndassa has to work for herself, is
<ce>                     that it? Well, %oth, it suits
<ce>                        me just fine, so there.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             M'name is Cyndassa. Daggerfall. I'll tell you
<ce>             everything I know, but I don't need to remind
<ce>           you that there ain't no such thing as free info,
<ce>                    do I, %pcn? I'm just a maid to
<ce>            her highness, nothing but a fleck to the world,
<ce>         and my needs ain't big. I need this werewolf done in.
<ce>             I know just where it is -- some %god forsook
<ce>               hole called Tristore Laboratory, off the
<ce>                    coast over Betony way. I can't
<ce>           tell you why, but it's important to me that that
<ce>          werewolf gets put outta its misery. I'll wait here
<ce>             for =2mondung_ days for you -- that oughta be
<ce>                            plenty of time.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     You think I'm an idiot, %pcn?
<ce>                  You think I don't know that loup is
<ce>                             still alive?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           It's dead then, is it? Poor thing. He used to be
<ce>             my brother. If you ask me, he died long ago,
<ce>            when he first got bit. He hated himself when he
<ce>            became that beast. I wish there'd been another
<ce>                           way to help him.
<ce>                                    
<ce>             I promised I'd tell you about that letter yer
<ce>            lookin for, didn't I now? Of course, I remember
<ce>                   that letter, %pcf. It's not every
<ce>              day that you gets a letter from the Emperor
<ce>             himself, especially seein' as the King ain't
<ce>            too fond of him. 'Fact, that's the only letter
<ce>            I ever seen from him. I give it to her majesty,
<ce>             and she's all excited and she rip it open and
<ce>             says "this isn't for me, this is addressed to
<ce>            Mynisera." Then... boom! Her jaw fall open and
<ce>              her eyes get real wide. She say she'll make
<ce>            sure the Queen Mother gets it and that I don't
<ce>                  have to worry myself none about it.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The werewolf of Tristore Laboratory has been terrifying Betony for weeks.
<--->
No one much cares about the werewolf of Tristore Laboratory except its neighbors.
<--->
Poor Aubk-i. Her maid's been spreading the wildest tales about her.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That werewolf moved on, out of Tristore Laboratory. Migratory beasts they are.
<--->
Didn't expect that loop to live in Tristore Laboratory for as long as it did.
<--->
Boy, those Shapeshifters sure put the kibosh on some %ra out yonder.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Some %ra adventurer chased the werewolf at Tristore Laboratory out of Betony.
<--->
The peasants who live around Tristore Laboratory are happy the loop is gone.
<--->
The Shapeshifters have some %ra to thank for saving one of their own.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                    The body of the werewolf begins
<ce>                     to transform before your very
<ce>                    eyes. In just a few minutes, it
<ce>                   has become a young man who seems
<ce>                    to bear a strong resemblence to
<ce>                               Cyndassa.

Message:  1011
<ce>                 %pcf, thanks ever so much for getting
<ce>                 him out of that trap. I'll deal with
<ce>             the Beldama myself to straighten things out.

Message:  1012
<ce>                       I well remember Cyndassa
<ce>           blabbering on about the Queen's private affairs.
<ce>              Amazing what a few drops of wine will do to
<ce>                     loosen a young girl's tongue.
<ce>               It isn't just every day a letter from the
<ce>               Emperor is delivered, especially as, you
<ce>              know, the Queen isn't all that fond of him.
<ce>              Cyndassa said that letter was the only one
<ce>               she'd ever seen from him, and was shocked
<ce>               when the Queen gasped and exclaimed "Why,
<ce>            this isn't for me, it's addressed to Mynisera."
<ce>             Poor Cyndassa.  She immediately thought that
<ce>            she'd misunderstood the courier and given that
<ce>            letter to the wrong noble.  She was so relieved
<ce>             when Aubk-i didn't make a fuss and said she'd
<ce>              make sure the Queen Mother got it promptly,
<ce>                   and not to worry herself over it.

Message:  1013
<ce>                  Oh, keep the _relic_, if you like.

Message:  1014
<ce>                   Why %pcf, you've found part of my
<ce>             old lover's diary. I'd recognize that writing
<ce>             anywhere. Cyndassa, the filthy little whore,
<ce>               had him infected by two different loups!
<ce>                                    
<ce>                Curing such is beyond our means today.
<ce>             The Beldama hopes through study to find one.
<ce>            She can reverse the process for several weeks,
<ce>             but no longer. Until now, we've seen no cases
<ce>          survive the initial infection any longer than that.
<ce>                                    
<ce>               If you can return with him to me, I have
<ce>               some information that may be of some use
<ce>                  to you. Take this special _relic_.
<ce>                  It will tame the beast within him.
<ce>                                    

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 I've met up with _barmaid_,
 an old lover of Cyndassa's brother.
 She has some information for me
 if only I can return her ex-lover
 by using this _relic_ somehow. She'll
 be waiting at _tavern_ 
 over in __tavern_.

Message:  1016
%qdt:
 I've found a page from a diary of Cyndassa's
 brother suggesting she paid to turn him into
 a lycanthrope out of spite.

Message:  1017
You find a diary fragment, written in
a scrawling hand.
 
"...I cannot believe Cyndassa acted so
spitefully, just because I broke up with
her friend, _barmaid_. Well,
I never much cared for visiting
___barmaid_ either, and
thought we parted amicably...
But paying to turn me in to the
Shapeshifters, I just don't get it.
Cyndassa must be picking up bad
ways from those rotten nobles at
the Daggerfall Court."

Message:  1018
You find a diary fragment, written in
a clear hand.
 
"...I have no memory of coming to this place.
If I've been kidnapped, for what? We have no
money, and Cyndassa is barely tolerated by the
nobles at court. My last clear memory is of
watching the moon rise over Castle Daggerfall..."

Message:  1019
Tsk. That Cyndassa is always up to something with her girlfriends.
<--->
Imagine that Queen Aubk-i lets her maid consort with ==barmaid_.
<--->
Unbelievable that Queen Aubk-i lets her maid consort with ==barmaid_.
<--->
Tut. That Cyndassa is always up to something with _barmaid_.

Message:  1020
_wereBrother_ broke her heart, and now she's taken up whoring over in _tavern_.
<--->
Some young scamp broke her heart, and now she just sulks over at __tavern_.
<--->
She's always out plying her craft, if you know what I mean, in __tavern_.
<--->
Didn't she get Cyndassa to turn her brother into a werewolf after he jilted her?

Message:  1021
Keep away from me %ra, you filthy assassin!
<--->
Assassin! I'll feed you to the guards, %ra!
<--->
How dare you approach me, you filthy were-monger!
<--->
Take your filthy were-mongering hide out of my sight, %ra!

Message:  1022
Keep away from me %ra! You're an idiot were-monger.
<--->
You fool! How could you fall for that simple maid's lies?
<--->
You foolish %ra. Don't tell me you fell for Cyndassa's lies!
<--->
I should set the 'shifters on your trail, %ra, after what you've done.

Message:  1023
%qdt:
 Cyndassa, the serving maid of Queen Aubk-i
 of Daggerfall has sent me to slay a werewolf
 holed up at Tristore Laboratory in Betony,
 for some reason. She can only pay me in
 information, and has promised to reveal
 what she knows of the Emperor's letter.
 I have =2mondung_ days to do this deed.

Message:  1024
<ce>                    The body of the werewolf begins
<ce>                     to transform before your very
<ce>                 eyes. In a few moments, it has become
<ce>                      a young man, _wereBrother_,
<ce>                     lying in a coma at your feet.
<ce>                        You gently pick him up.

Message:  1025
Now that Cyndassa's waiting at the Castle her whole family's put on airs.
<--->
Sibling rivalry's all the rage over in ___wereBrother_.
<--->
Tsk. The things youngsters will try to get attention.

Message:  1026
Property of the Shapeshifter's Guild

Message:  1027
You feel a sickening jolt as the _relic_ vanishes.

Message:  1028
<ce>                    Have you lost your mind, %pct?
<ce>                 I was inclined to help you, but after
<ce>                   your assault on _wereBrother_ ...
<ce>                Slink along back to that whore Cyndassa
<ce>                why don't you. Worthless piece of %ra.

Message:  1029
<ce>                  On second thought, %pct, why don't
<ce>                   I just tag along.  I'll hold the
<ce>                         _relic_, as it can be
<ce>                         a bit tricky to use.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _barmaid_ told me that Cyndassa
 delivered a letter intended for Mynisera
 to Queen Aubk-i, who promised to turn it
 over to the Queen mother right away.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 I need to escort _barmaid_ and
 _wereBrother_ to the Coven
 on the Bluff in Daggerfall.

Message:  1032
<ce>         As the body of the werewolf slowly freezes in place,
<ce>                  _barmaid_ speaks: "Excellent, %pcf,
<ce>           I will keep my promise to tell you what I know of
<ce>                      that letter you're after."

Message:  1033
<ce>              Now, if I might beg the favor of escorting
<ce>                us to the Beldama of the Sisters of the
<ce>                  Bluff. You'll find it on the map in
<ce>                        in Daggerfall province.

Message:  1034
<ce>                         %pcf, your service to
<ce>                    the Coven has been invaluable.
<ce>                     Please, feel free to call at
<ce>                               any time.

Message:  1035
<ce>                  _barmaid_ looks at you in disgust.
<ce>                    "Whadda you trying to do, %ra?
<ce>                       Kidnap us?" She picks up
<ce>                           _wereBrother_ and
<ce>                       disappears into thin air.

Message:  1036
<ce>                     _barmaid_ begins whispering:
<ce>                    "Ok %pcf, here's what we'll do.
<ce>                   We'll split up, and make our way
<ce>                        to _wereBrother_. Then
<ce>                   while you distract him, I'll cast
<ce>               the spell to tame the beast within him."
