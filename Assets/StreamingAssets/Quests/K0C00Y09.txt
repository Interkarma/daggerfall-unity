QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                       My former partner here at
<ce>                       __qgiver_, a _enemy_, has
<ce>             taken more than %g3 fair share of our profits
<ce>                     and run away from ___qgiver_.
<ce>              Now, I'm not the vengeful sort, but I would
<ce>              appreciate it if you would bring the _enemy_
<ce>             back to me, so I can get some explanation for
<ce>             this remarkable behavior. I'll pay you _gold_
<ce>               gold pieces for %g2 alive, and _lessgold_
<ce>                   gold if you accidentally kill %g2.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     That damnable _enemy_ let me
<ce>               trust %g2, led me merrily along, and then
<ce>            left without a word but with a sizeable portion
<ce>              of my savings. Now the money does bother me,
<ce>              but not as much as the betrayal. I want you
<ce>              to track %g2 down, and bring %g2 to me, and
<ce>                 I'm willing to pay _gold_ gold pieces
<ce>                   for it. Are you willing and able?
                                     <--->
<ce>                   I am looking for a manhunter, or,
<ce>                  more specifically, a _enemy_ hunter.
<ce>                You see, %g left town without paying the
<ce>               gold %g owes me. It's the principle of the
<ce>               thing. I don't mind paying you _gold_ gold
<ce>               pieces for %g3 capture, but my reputation
<ce>                would be ruined if I let my debtors just
<ce>                    leave ___qgiver_, owing me gold.
<ce>                   Will you get this deadbeat for me?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      No? Well, I'll just go down
<ce>                     to the Fighters Guild and hire
<ce>                             someone else.
                                     <--->
<ce>                    That's too bad. Let me know if
<ce>                         you change your mind.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Good. The _enemy_'s name is
<ce>                     =enemy_, and rumor has it that
<ce>                     %g is holed up in ___mondung_
<ce>              for =queston_ days at most. That will be the
<ce>              deadline by which I expect to hear from you.
<ce>                         Remember -- =enemy_ is
<ce>                  a tough _enemy_, so expect a fight,
<ce>               but try not to kill %g2. I want %g2 alive,
<ce>                       not dead. Good luck, %pcf.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 That's fine then. My sources tell me
<ce>                   that the _enemy_ has taken refuge
<ce>                    in ___mondung_ and will probably
<ce>               be there for =queston_ days or so. I fully
<ce>                       expect =enemy_, that's the
<ce>               _enemy_'s name, to put up a fight, but try
<ce>               not to kill %g2. I will expect you back in
<ce>                       =queston_ days. Good luck.
                                     <--->
<ce>                    Frightfully good of you, %pcf.
<ce>             I've made some inquiries and it seems that our
<ce>              _enemy_ friend is lurking about the vicinity
<ce>                     of ___mondung_, unguarded and
<ce>            alone except for the usual brutes in residence.
<ce>                        =enemy_ is %g3 name and
<ce>             I will expect %g2 before me in =queston_ days,
<ce>                 preferably alive. Don't disappoint me.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        Ah, good day, =enemy_.
<ce>              It seems to me that we have some business to
<ce>                    discuss, don't we? %pcf, I thank
<ce>                   you for making this _enemy_'s trip
<ce>                as comfortable as possible. Here is the
<ce>                        _gold_ gold I promised.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_qgiver_ was a fool to do business with someone like =enemy_.
<--->
_qgiver_ should never have trusted =enemy_ -- %g is a notorious thief.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
=enemy_ apparently got away with it. And _qgiver_ is mad as Oblivion.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_qgiver_ is practicing ancient %ra torture techniques on =enemy_.
<--->
I'd hate to be _enemy_ right now -- in _qgiver_'s hands.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Oh hello, %pcf. =enemy_ would say hello too ... if %g still had a tongue.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce> You don't really think I'd have anything to say to you, do you, %pcf?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 __qgiver_, ___qgiver_
 has sent me to ___mondung_
 to find an errant _enemy_ named
 =enemy_ and bring %g2
 back to __qgiver_. I
 have =queston_ days to accomplish this,
 and _qgiver_ stressed
 that %g wanted =enemy_
 alive.

Message:  1011
<ce>                            _qgiver_ wanted
<ce>                           =enemy_ alive, but
<ce>                            you've slain %g2.

Message:  1012
<ce>                              Ow! %oth, I
<ce>                               surrender!
                                     <--->
<ce>                              I give up!
<ce>                               I give up!
                                     <--->
<ce>                            Don't kill me!
<ce>                              I surrender!

Message:  1013
<ce>                          =enemy_ sneaks away
<ce>                     when you aren't looking. It's
<ce>                      just as well. It's too late
<ce>                        to collect on the reward
<ce>                                anyhow.

Message:  1014
<ce>                      Well, I had wanted =enemy_
<ce>                alive, but I suppose I would have killed
<ce>             %g2 eventually myself. Here's _lessgold_ gold
<ce>                 pieces. Not the full amount, but I am
<ce>                             appreciative.
