QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               There's a nightmare stalking the streets
<ce>                    of ___bookstore_. They're calling him the
<ce>                       ___bookstore_ Slayer, and so far no
<ce>               one can tell me if he's a man or a beast.
<ce>                  One of my finest sages, _contact_,
<ce>               is examing the bodies of the victims, but
<ce>                %g has begun getting disturbing letters
<ce>                and frankly fears for %g3 life. I need
<ce>              someone to investigate %g3 findings to see
<ce>               if %g3 fears are justified. Will you help
<ce>                    me in this, %pcf? I will offer
<ce>              you _reward_ gold pieces in return for the
<ce>                     retirement of the ___bookstore_ Slayer.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Not an uncommon response. Then I have
<ce>                 little choice, but to call on some of
<ce>                 my less savoury contacts for help --
<ce>                   an option I was hoping to avoid.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Thank %god for that anyway.
<ce>                    The people of %reg are becoming
<ce>               anxious about the lack of progress in the
<ce>                official investigations. I fear that we
<ce>                will have a mob situation soon, perhaps
<ce>                  in =total_ days or less. _contact_
<ce>                       works out of _bookstore_,
<ce>                 and I told %g2 I'd be sending someone
<ce>                  there soon. Watch out for yourself,
<ce>                     %pcf. Until this situation is
<ce>                    resolved, remember that the ___bookstore_
<ce>                          night has a knife.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                        The ___bookstore_ Slayer is still
<ce>                at large. I have no time for chatting,
<ce>                            nor should you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     %reg is at peace again, %pcf,
<ce>          thanks to you. Here is the _reward_ gold I promised
<ce>             -- gladly will I give it for the end of that
<ce>              maniac and your discretion in this matter.
<ce>                    %god truly blessed us when you
<ce>                             came to %reg.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
It isn't safe to walk the streets of ___bookstore_ anymore. Not with the ___bookstore_ Slayer.
<--->
I hear the Slayer isn't a man at all, but a daedra come to punish us all.
<--->
The last victim of the ___bookstore_ Slayer was found scattered in pieces over ___bookstore_.
<--->
Some folks are wondering if the Slayer might be a vampire or a werewolf.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The killings stopped without us needing a mob. Guess the Slayer moved on.
<--->
_qgiver_'s just lucky the ___bookstore_ Slayer decided to move on. Panic was setting in.
<--->
_qgiver_ is still anxious. You'd think the Slayer's absence would relieve %g2.
<--->
The ___bookstore_ Slayer disappeared just as suddenly as he came to ___bookstore_.
<--->
Some say the Slayer's still here, waiting for the stars to be right again.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I'm still afraid to be out in ___bookstore_ alone, even with the Slayer supposedly dead.
<--->
Guess the ___bookstore_ Slayer was just some poor lunatic. Nothing romantic to him at all.
<--->
The newest rumor is that the ___bookstore_ Slayer wasn't a vampire, but thought he was.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I still remember you, %pcf, and the discretion you showed with the ___bookstore_ Slayer.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    You failed me in the ___bookstore_ Slayer
<ce>                         affair, %pcf. I don't
<ce>                  see any reason to believe you won't
<ce>                            fail me again.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                        Ah, %pcf, my dear %ra,
<ce>                I am very glad you've arrived. You have
<ce>              doubtless been told that I've become a bit
<ce>               of a hermit ever since I began receiving
<ce>                those letters threatening my life if I
<ce>              did not abandoned my investigations. Well,
<ce>               now I have an old colleague in town with
<ce>                whose assistance I may be able to solve
<ce>               these murders. I would like you to bring
<ce>                       these notes to a _vamp_,
<ce>                       a =vamp_ you will find at
<ce>                      _hookerhouse_. If anything
<ce>               should happen to me, I want someone to be
<ce>              able to continue on in the investigations.
<ce>                        That will be _vamp_ and
<ce>                   you, %pcf. So don't get yourself
<ce>                           killed out there.

Message:  1011
_contact_,
 
 Terminate your investigations of the %reg Slayer's
 victims if you value your life. You are moving
 blindly into an inferno.
 
 If you continue, you will die before your
 studies are finished. Consider this this a
 serious warning.
 
<ce>                             A Well-Wisher

Message:  1012
Dear _contact_,
 
 Even if you lock all your doors and extinguish
 all light from _bookstore_, we
 will know that you are still indulging in your
 forbidden autopsies. Do not ask for us to
 demonstrate our power to stop you, for we will
 act but once.
 
<ce>                             A Well-Wisher

Message:  1013
_contact_,
 
 I would very much like to meet with you
 about your fascinating mortuary studies of
 the Slayer victims. As you know, I have
 done similar investigations and would be
 happy to share my knowledge and experience
 with a distinguished colleague.
 
 Let me know by courier how it would be
 most convenient for us to meet. I am
 staying at _hookerhouse_,
 but perhaps you would rather meet at
 _bookstore_ so I might
 see the corpses in question. In either
 case I look forward to receiving your
 courier and note.
 
<ce>                         Yours in admiration,
 
<ce>                                _vamp_

Message:  1014
Autopsy report for %fn:
 
 Throat torn out, apparently
 with violent force (Slayer a
 madman? Check into Lobornus'
 work with criminally insane in Agryn
 Prison). Death instantaneous,
 no sign of struggle (Slayer knew
 victim? Did not appear a threat?)
 Carotid artery completely severed,
 loss of blood extensive by time of
 examination (remember to ask
 _qgiver_ to send over guards
 who found body for interview).
 
 Autopsy report for %mn:
 
 Subject shows similar pathology to
 female victim. Throat torn out violently,
 bruises on upper arms as if gripped by
 extremely strong man (Slayer's insanity
 produces superhuman strength? Note to self:
 write to Lobornus for research notes from
 interesting case he reported at last year's
 Conclave). Bruising indicates some time
 between attack and death? (Could be unrelated
 to attack? Check on background of victim)

Message:  1015
<ce>                    So, for all the days _contact_
<ce>                has spent with those flyblown cadavers
<ce>                       and all %g comes up with
<ce>                     is this. %god, with this as a
<ce>                      start, _contact_ won't get
<ce>                an intimation of the Slayer's identity
<ce>                     for weeks yet. Listen, %pcf,
<ce>                     if you want to help _qgiver_,
<ce>                   take this flower over to _widow_
<ce>                        in _widowhouse_ -- %g3
<ce>                        brother was %mn, one of
<ce>                  the Slayer's victims. This may seem
<ce>                 like a trivial sentimentality, but it
<ce>                 will bring you closer to finding the
<ce>                        ___bookstore_ Slayer than any of
<ce>                        _contact_'s scientific
<ce>                      catalyses. Trust me, %pcf.

Message:  1016
_vamp_ is the =vamp_ I met over at _hookerhouse_. Nice enough, but spooky.
<--->
_vamp_ is the name of the =vamp_ staying over at _hookerhouse_.

Message:  1017
_vamp_ is one of the %vcn, sent to ___bookstore_ to eliminate the mad Slayer.
<--->
_vamp_ is a %vcn vampire here to stop the risk to %g3 security, the Slayer.

Message:  1018
Poor _widow_ stays at _widowhouse_ every since the Slayer got %g3 brother.
<--->
The %reg Slayer killed _widow_'s brother, and now %g never leaves _widowhouse_.

Message:  1019
<ce>               A red poppy? Oh, you must be my brother's
<ce>                    friend, _rippername_, yes? I do
<ce>             appreciate the comforting note you sent after
<ce>             his death. He didn't have very many friends,
<ce>            and, to tell the truth, he had never mentioned
<ce>             your name. But I certainly thank you for the
<ce>              lovely flowers and the invitation to visit
<ce>                         you at _ripperhouse_.
<ce>              I've always admired that place, and I would
<ce>                     like to see the inside of it.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                  What, you're not _rippername_? Oh,
<ce>              I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, I haven't
<ce>              been myself since my brother... No, I don't
<ce>             think I have information that might help you
<ce>              find that murdering devil. You know I would
<ce>              help you if I could. But you will find the
<ce>               fiend that killed my brother, won't you?

Message:  1020
%qdat:
 I am on the trail of the Slayer
 of ___bookstore_. The %rt wants
 the ___bookstore_ Slayer caught in =total_ days
 before the murders inflame the populace
 to riot. _qgiver_ has a scientist
 who has been examining the bodies of the
 Slayer's victims and has recently
 begun getting death threats, apparently
 from the Slayer. _contact_ is
 the name of this scientist, and %g
 works out of _bookstore_.

Message:  1021
%qdat:
 _contact_ has sent me
 to _hookerhouse_ to meet with
 an old colleague named _vamp_,
 who might be able to help with the research.

Message:  1022
%qdat:
 I got to _bookstore_ too late.
 Apparently _contact_'s death
 threats were very real. Among the letters
 I found was one from a colleague interested in
 meeting with _contact_, someone
 named _vamp_ staying at
 _hookerhouse_.

Message:  1023
%qdat:
 I met with _vamp_ who seems
 less than impressed with %g3
 colleague _contact_'s work
 on the %reg Slayer victims.
 _vamp_ told me to bring
 a red poppy to someone named
 _widow_ whose brother
 was killed by the Slayer. I have some
 suspicions, but I won't know for sure
 until I go to _widowhouse_
 where _widow_ lives.

Message:  1024
%qdat:
 The late _contact_'s colleague
 and murderer are one and the same person.
 _vamp_ is a vampire, but professes
 not to be the Slayer. If I kill the person
 %g says is the %reg Slayer, _rippername_
 of _ripperhouse_, _vamp_
 has promised me a reward, apparently
 in addition to the reward I'd get
 from _qgiver_.

Message:  1025
%qdat:
 _widow_, the =widow_
 _vamp_ sent me to, believed
 that I was someone named _rippername_.
 This _rippername_ apparently sent
 _widow_ a bouquet of red poppies
 and invited %g2 to a place called
 _ripperhouse_. Sounds like a Slayer
 trap if there ever was one.

Message:  1026
<ce>                 Which letter brought you to me, %pcn?
<ce>             You are probably aware that I wrote them all.
<ce>                      After _contact_ refused to
<ce>           listen to my polite warnings about investigating
<ce>            matters beyond mortal understanding, I invited
<ce>             %g2 here as %g3 friend. I knew %g2, you see,
<ce>             years ago, before I became a vampire. We met,
<ce>                      went back to _bookstore_ to
<ce>              see the bodies, and there I slew %g2. Quite
<ce>             painlessly. I could tell %g would never have
<ce>              halted his studies. More than that I cannot
<ce>               say, except that the Slayer is a vampire
<ce>               like myself, but mad from the blessing of
<ce>                      immortality. _rippername_,
<ce>             that's the Slayer's real name and %g lives at
<ce>                    _ripperhouse_. If you go there
<ce>            and slay %g2, I will reward you. If you intend
<ce>                     to continue with _contact_'s
<ce>              studies, I will have no choice but to kill
<ce>                 you as well. That is my simple offer.

Message:  1027
_contact_ is quite a learned scientist over in _bookstore_, %di of here.
<--->
_contact_ is a =contact_ who works out of _bookstore_.

Message:  1028
_contact_ is dissecting the Slayer's victims and someone doesn't like that.
<--->
_contact_'s a scientist at _bookstore_, who has been getting threat letters.

Message:  1029
<ce>  The Mad Slayer is no more.

Message:  1050
<ce>                   By killing _rippername_, you have
<ce>                 aided both %reg and myself. For this,
<ce>                  I give you a _reward2_. Perhaps we
<ce>                     may meet again one day, %pcn.
<ce>                  You have intrigued me in our brief
<ce>              acquaintance. May the night keep you safe.
