QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>          We've got a little job you might be interested in.
<ce>            Seems there's a loup -- whatcha call your basic
<ce>             werewolf, wereboar, or some kind 'o werebeasty
<ce>                 that's been bothering a lot of farmers
<ce>              in the area, and we need someone to kill it.
<ce>          It'll mean _reward_ gold in your pocket. That sound
<ce>                          interesting to you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Fine. Guess someone else'll have to do it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Great. You'll find the loup over in
<ce>                     ___mondung_. We need the poor
<ce>                 brute dead in =1stparton_ days, so you
<ce>                      better be on your way, kid.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               Loup too much for you, kid, or didn't you
<ce>               even try? Ah well, it's probably moved on
<ce>                        by now anyhow. Too bad.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Good job, Loup-killer. Enjoy yer gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I've heard there's some kind of werewolf on the loose around here.
<--->
I hear the wereboar's found a lair in someplace called ___mondung_.
<--->
Didja hear that howling last night? Wolf howling?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Werewolves are real nomads, I guess. I hear our loup moved down south.
<--->
My cousin tells me that our wereboar was spotted down south aways.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear they found out that werething was a priest during the day!
<--->
A lot of people feel safer knowing that werebeast is dead.
<--->
You heard about that werewolf some %ra hunted down?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>           Thanks for taking care of that werecritter %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  Get outta here. You're so pathetic.
<ce>                   You couldn't even handle a werewolf.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   The lycanthrope threat is ended.

Message:  1021
<ce>                     This must be the "werebeast"
<ce>                      everyone is afraid of. Just
<ce>                       an ordinary grizzly bear.

%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild of
 ___questgiver_ has hired
 me to kill a troublesome werewolf,
 wereboar, or whatever, in its lair,
 ___mondung_. The beast needs
 to be dead in =1stparton_ days
 time for me to collect my payment.

Message:  1080
<ce>                    Here's a map to a place called
<ce>                     ___newdung_.  All the killing
<ce>                      and treasure you can handle.
