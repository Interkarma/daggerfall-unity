<ce>                     Thou wouldst help ==qgiver_,
<ce>                    %pcf? Many come to us for aid,
<ce>                   and then turn from us once their
<ce>                   wishes have been met, their oaths
<ce>                    are curses, their promises are
<ce>                    abominations. For the gratitude
<ce>                         of ==qgiver_, wouldst
<ce>                     thou punish one transgressor
<ce>                          for the sisterhood?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Not even that wouldst thou do?
<ce>                         %oth, by ==daedra_, I
<ce>                  suppose it is better not to promise
<ce>                  what thou cannot deliver, yet still
<ce>                            I am aggrieved.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Wilt thou truly? If thou wilt, a fine
<ce>                        _mitem_ will be crafted
<ce>                for thee. Now, journey thou to farthest
<ce>                     __tavern_ and seek the one who has
<ce>                    betrayed us, a villainous =man_
<ce>                       who calls %g2-self _man_.
<ce>                Give to %g2 this _jewelry_, tell %g2 it
<ce>                is a gift from %g3 old lover, and then
<ce>                 come back to us. Thou must to hurry,
<ce>                 for the _jewelry_ will transform %g3
<ce>                 outerself to a semblance of %g3 inner
<ce>                        beauty. ==qgiver_ wilt
<ce>                  expect thee in =queston_ days. May
<ce>                        ==daedra_ smile on thy
<ce>                             sacred quest.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       Good %pcf, thy promise to
<ce>                      ==qgiver_ is fulfilled.
<ce>                         Here is the _mitem_ I
<ce>                         promised. Poor _man_.
<ce>                I hope they allow %g2 to suffer deeply,
<ce>                      before %g is put to death.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_man_ is a true example of self-made =man_. A marvel to behold.
<--->
==qgiver_ can be extremely vengeful.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_man_ is laughing at the idea that %g owes anything to ==qgiver_.
<--->
_man_ has left __tavern_. And %g will be sorely missed.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_man_ transformed into a horrible beast before the tavernfolk at _tavern_.
<--->
_man_ must have been trafficking with daedra. %oth, what a fate.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Truly, I hope thou art enjoying thy _mitem_, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      Our vengeance against _man_
<ce>                 is not complete! Get thee from here,
<ce>                 or %g3 deserved fate wilt be visited
<ce>                           upon thou, %pcf.

Message:  1011
<ce>                         _man_ thanks you for
<ce>                   the _jewelry_. %g tries it on as
<ce>                 you are telling %g2 who sent it. %g3
<ce>                   eyes light up in fear at the name
<ce>                      of ==qgiver_, and then the
<ce>                          fear turns to pain.

Message:  1012
<ce>                     Thou wert not to kill _man_,
<ce>                   merely give to %g2 the _jewelry_!
<ce>                         Oaf! Assassin! _man_
<ce>                was to suffer deeply for %g3 insolence,
<ce>                       not be painlessly slain.
<ce>                            ==daedra_ curse
<ce>                              thee, %pcf.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 ==qgiver_ of
 %reg has sent me to bring a
 _jewelry_ to a =man_ by the name of
 _man_ in __tavern_.
 I was told to move hastily for the
 _jewelry_ would "transform %g3
 outerself to a semblance of %g3
 inner beauty." I must have the
 _jewelry_ in %g3 hands and
 get back with ==qgiver_ in
 no more than =queston_ days.
