QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               %pct, I have a dangerous mission for you.
<ce>              I will tell you up front it involves slaying
<ce>                   a rather powerful undead creature.
<ce>                   Are you still willing to undertake
<ce>                      this task for __questgiver_?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Well, I certainly cannot blame you.
<ce>                      I myself would not dare it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Your courage honors our order, %pcf.
<ce>                   We wish to begin cleansing a place
<ce>                    called ___mondung_.  Long ago it
<ce>                    was one of our temples, but its
<ce>                  desecrated corridors are now haunted
<ce>                  by some undead apparition.  You must
<ce>                 slay this unquiet spirit and sprinkle
<ce>                 its body with this specially prepared
<ce>                 holy water.  If you have not returned
<ce>                in =qtime_ days I will burn incense for
<ce>                your departed soul and send someone else
<ce>                 to avenge you.  May %god go with you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   %pct, if you did not wish to help
<ce>                    cleanse ___mondung_, you should
<ce>                        have told me so before.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Praise %god, you have returned safely!
<ce>                    Our seers already reported that
<ce>                    the evil within ___mondung_ had
<ce>                   been cleansed.  You have done well
<ce>                    in the service of __questgiver_.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
__questgiver_ is planning to restore ___mondung_ to its former glory.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>It looks like the evil within ___mondung_ is too strong for __questgiver_
<ce>                             to drive out.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce> __questgiver_ sent one of their order to begin cleansing ___mondung_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>       Greetings, %pcf.  Your foray into ___mondung_ was a great
<ce>                              help to us.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>        What can I do for you?  You failed me when I asked you
<ce>             for help with the evil spirit of ___mondung_.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ has sent me
 to slay an undead creature haunting
 ___mondung_.  %g gave me a vial
 of specially prepared holy water
 which I must sprinkle on the monster's
 body in order to prevent its spirit
 from returning.  I have =qtime_ days
 to return to _questgiver_ or %g
 will have to send someone else.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ has sent me
 to slay an undead creature haunting
 ___mondung_.  First, however, I
 must visit _priest_ in __priest_
 of ___priest_, who will place the
 final blessing on a vial of specially
 prepared holy water.  I need to sprinkle
 it on the monster's body in order to
 prevent its spirit from returning to
 ___mondung_.  I have =qtime_ days
 to return to _questgiver_ or %g
 will have to send someone else.

Message:  1050
<ce>                Ah, wait, I am so forgetful these days!
<ce>                 You first need to take the holy water
<ce>                      to _priest_, of __priest_ in
<ce>                  ___priest_.  %g will place the final
<ce>                            blessing on it.

Message:  1051
<ce>                   _priest_ takes the vial from you
<ce>                  without a word.  %g gravely blesses
<ce>                    it, then you.  %g hands it back
<ce>                    and returns to %g3 meditations.

Message:  1060
<ce>                      "I am =monster1_!  You may
<ce>                       slay my material form, but
<ce>                       I will always return to my
<ce>                       home here in ___mondung_!"

Message:  1061
<ce>                    As you sprinkle the holy water
<ce>                      over =monster1_'s remains, a
<ce>                     despairing wail echoes through
<ce>                     the dark halls of ___mondung_,
<ce>                    slowly fading into the distance.
