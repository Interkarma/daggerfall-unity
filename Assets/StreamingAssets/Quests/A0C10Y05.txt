QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    I am betrothed to _betrothed_.
<ce>                  My great misfortune is that _ruler_
<ce>                    has other plans for _betrothed_.
<ce>                My only hope is to get %g2 to the temple
<ce>               and complete the marriage ceremony before
<ce>                  _ruler_ catches us. Will you protect
<ce>                   me while I get my betrothed to the
<ce>               temple? I can pay you _gold_ gold pieces.
                                     <--->
<ce>                    In __betrothedhome_, my darling
<ce>                    _betrothed_ awaits me, tormented
<ce>                  by the tyranny of the cruel _ruler_.
<ce>                    I cannot sleep while _betrothed_
<ce>                is so imprisoned, but I fear the agents
<ce>                    of _ruler_, who work to keep us
<ce>                     apart. Will you go with me to
<ce>                    __betrothedhome_ and protect me?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Alas, I shall have to find another
<ce>                     guardian to protect my beloved
<ce>                        _betrothed_ from _ruler_

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     My gratitude will be endless
<ce>                     %pcn. Quickly, let us away to
<ce>                      get _betrothed_. We can find
<ce>                         %g2 at _betrothedhome_
<ce>                          in __betrothedhome_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   %pcf, we are indebted to you. Now
<ce>                     that the ceremony is underway,
<ce>                    _ruler_ cannot prevent it. Here
<ce>               are the _gold_ gold pieces I promised you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                    _ruler_ must be trying to build
<ce>               a harem. I hear %g just sent %g3 guardsmen
<ce>                      out to pick up _betrothed_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                    I hear that _betrothed_ joined
<ce>                  _ruler_'s harem. Not much difference
<ce>               between that and kidnapping if you ask me.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                     _qgiver_ and _betrothed_ just
<ce>                got married. Isn't that wonderful news?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                 _betrothed_ and I thank you. Without
<ce>                your help, %g would have been forced to
<ce>                             marry _ruler_.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  I have lost my _betrothed_ forever!
<ce>                   %g has been forced to wed _ruler_.
<ce>                 Any you want me to help you? Get out!

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_
 asked me to escort %g2 to
 __betrothedhome_ to find
 _betrothed_. _qgiver_
 is betrothed to _betrothed_
 but _ruler_ wants to
 kill _qgiver_ to prevent
 the marriage. They are to
 be wed at _temple_
 in __temple_.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      Ah my beloved _betrothed_!
<ce>                           %pcn has agreed to
<ce>                        protect us from _ruler_.
<ce>                          Quickly, %pcn, take
<ce>                             us to _temple_
<ce>                             at __temple_.

Message:  1012
<ce>                       We are under orders from
<ce>                           _ruler_ to prevent
<ce>                     this marraige. If _betrothed_
<ce>                       comes with us now, nobody
<ce>                             will get hurt.

Message:  1013
<ce>                           So, _qgiver_, you
<ce>                       have hired some puny runt
<ce>                        to protect you. _ruler_
<ce>                       will not be happy that you
<ce>                        resisted him. Step aside
<ce>                      and let us take _betrothed_.
<ce>                       It can only get worse for
<ce>                                  you.

Message:  1014
<ce>                           _qgiver_ whispers
<ce>                         excitedly, "Yes!  This
<ce>                      is the place where _ruler_'s
<ce>                     thugs are holding my beloved.
<ce>                            We must hurry!"

Message:  1015
<ce>                             "%oth," cries
<ce>                           _qgiver_, "here is
<ce>                         _temple_!  Now we just
<ce>                         need _priest_ to marry
<ce>                        us and _betrothed_ will
<ce>                          be out of _ruler_'s
<ce>                            reach for good!"

Message:  1020
<ce>                     _qgiver_ shakes %g2 head with
<ce>                  disgust.  "I'll have to try to save
<ce>                      _betrothed_ myself, I guess.
<ce>                        You let me down, %pcf."
