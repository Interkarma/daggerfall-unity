<ce>                            I am _qgiver_.
<ce>                I have a relatively menial job, if you
<ce>                are willing to take it. Actually, some
<ce>                members prefer these jobs because they
<ce>                pay just as well as the more difficult
<ce>                ones. A house here in town has infested
<ce>                by giant rodents. The wife claims they
<ce>                 are rats, the husband claims they are
<ce>                bats. Either way, they want them gone.
<ce>                          Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Obviously you have no love for the
<ce>                 Fighter's Guild. I will make sure to
<ce>                   tell them what you really think.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    The bats have infested _house_.
<ce>                 Go there and kill them all and you'll
<ce>                 get your pay. I can only give you one
<ce>                        day to finish this one.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Killing bats, even giant ones,
<ce>                    doesn't take much skill, but it
<ce>                          pays the same, eh?

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                   Some idiot didn't repair his roof
<ce>                   for a couple of months. Now she's
<ce>                     got giant bats in her house.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                   Did you hear about the woman that
<ce>                    had to abandon her home? It was
<ce>                    overrun with giant bats and she
<ce>                  didn't have enough gold to pay the
<ce>                     Fighters Guild to kill them.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 I heard the Fighters Guild sent some
<ce>                   %ra over to kill the bats in that
<ce>                 woman's home. Cost her a bundle, but
<ce>                 I suppose its better than abandoning
<ce>                               her home.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  So you killed the giant bats. Don't
<ce>                  get too full of yourself. They were
<ce>                           only giant bats.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 You couldn't even take care of giant
<ce>                     bats. You are hopeless %pcn.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild of ___qgiver_
 has asked me rid _house_
 of the giant rats or bats that have
 infested it. I have one day to get it done.

Message:  1011
<ce>  You faintly hear the sound of several rats' claws
<ce>  scratching the ground. They seem to be drawing closer.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You faintly hear the sound of several bats chittering.
<ce>  They seem to be drawing closer.

Message:  1020
<ce>                That's most of them. The Fighters Guild
<ce>                     won't quibble over the rest.
