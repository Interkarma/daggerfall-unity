<ce>                            %pcn, isn't it?
<ce>                      Just who I was looking for.
<ce>                   We have a rather interesting job,
<ce>                   requiring a bit of brains rather
<ce>                    than brawn. Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Yeah, you're right, I did say this
<ce>                      job needed brains didn't I?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Here's the situation. Seems _dummy_
<ce>                has this pet sabertooth tiger -- don't
<ce>                 ask -- and it ran off a few days ago.
<ce>                   %g had it tracked to ___mondung_,
<ce>                but now we need someone to go in there
<ce>                  and bring it out. Alive. The trick
<ce>                 is that it's been trained to respond
<ce>                 to this bell. The tiger should become
<ce>               docile if you ring the bell in its face.
<ce>                  Of course, _dummy_ did say it isn't
<ce>               trained too well -- are you surprised? --
<ce>                so you may have to smack it upside the
<ce>               head once or twice to get its attention.
<ce>                Just don't kill it, OK?  Bring it back
<ce>                  to _dummy_ at __dummy_ in one piece
<ce>                  within =qtime_ days, and %g'll pay
<ce>                      you _gold_ gold. Good luck.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    Don't look at me. The tiger is
<ce>                       in ___mondung_. Take your
<ce>                      little bell and get going.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Oh, =tiger_, darling, you're safe!
<ce>                   Thank you so much for bringing my
<ce>                    baby back home to me. I'm sure
<ce>                    he didn't give you any trouble,
<ce>                   did he? He's just a big kitty cat
<ce>                    at heart, wouldn't hurt a fly.
<ce>                  Here's your _gold_ gold, just like
<ce>                   I promised that nice _questgiver_
<ce>                        at the Fighter's Guild.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>     Did you hear that _dummy_'s tiger escaped again?  Killed and
<ce>                      ate three people this time.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>    _dummy_'s tiger seems to have disappeared for good. Thank %god!

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>     _dummy_ actually hired someone from the Fighter's Guild to go
<ce>fetch %g3 pet tiger for %g2. What sap would take a silly job like that?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                Howdy, %pcf, you old tiger-lover, you!

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>  I can't really think of an easier job than finding a pet tiger, but
<ce>           you managed to screw it up. What do you want now?

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I have been hired by ___questgiver_'s
 Fighters Guild to find a pet sabertooth
 tiger that has run off into ___mondung_.
 Supposedly the tiger is trained to respond
 to a bell I was given, but _questgiver_
 warned me that it may not really be trained
 very well. I am to bring the tiger back
 to its owner, _dummy_, at __dummy_
 of ___dummy_ within =qtime_ days.
 %g'll pay me _gold_ gold.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 I found the tiger in ___mondung_,
 and now it seems to like me. It has
 started following me, at least. Now
 I just have to get it back to _dummy_
 in ___dummy_.

 Message:  1022
%qdt:
 I found the tiger in ___mondung_,
 but I killed it. The best I can do now
 is go to __dummy_ of ___dummy_
 and apologize to _dummy_
 for the botched job.

Message:  1030
<ce>                      Oops. You killed the tiger.
<ce>                    I wonder what _dummy_ will say?

Message:  1040
<ce>                       You ring the bell loudly,
<ce>                      but it doesn't seem to have
<ce>                              any effect.

Message:  1041
<ce>                      The tiger's ears perk up at
<ce>                       the sound of the bell. It
<ce>                    shakes its great head from side
<ce>                     to side, and begins emitting
<ce>                      a low growling sound. Is it
<ce>                     purring? The tiger pads over
<ce>                      and rubs against your legs,
<ce>                       nearly knocking you over.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                    The tiger is now following you.

Message:  1050
<ce>                      You horrible horrible %ra!
<ce>                     I can't believe you killed my
<ce>                      poor innocent =tiger_. Just
<ce>                      a sweet lost kitty, and you
<ce>                       just had to slaughter it.
<ce>                       Get out of here at once,
<ce>                      before I have you arrested
<ce>                         for murder. Get out!

Message:  1060
Dear _love_,
 
 I am sorry I can't be with you today
 in __lovehouse_, but I wanted to take a
 moment to let you know that you are
 in my thoughts as always, my sweet.
 I am sitting here under a tree, on a
 beautiful afternoon that reminds me
 of you. Everything reminds me of you,
 my darling, the shining sun in the sky,
 the chirping birds in the trees, even
 the pretty pet tiger walking with its
 owner over there. Ha ha! The tiger has
 gotten loose, the scamp. It is bounding
 over my way. See how its coat gleams in
 the sun, like your hair in the firelight.
 Its owner is shouting something and ringing
 a little bell, but it doesn't listen. Such
 a high spirited beast! It seems friendly
 enough, here it comes to say hello...

Message:  1061
<ce>                   Yes, what do you want?  Oh...good
<ce>                   gracious, a letter from _victim_!
<ce>                     Why is it stained with blood?
<ce>                    %g's dead?  Dear me. %g always
<ce>                    was so sweet to me, I'm afraid
<ce>                   %g had the delusion that we were
<ce>                   in love. Poor soul, what a tragic
<ce>                    end. I certainly appreciate you
<ce>                    telling me what happened. I'll
<ce>                   make sure %g3 family knows. Here,
<ce>                    why don't you take this _magic_
<ce>                     %g gave me. I certainly don't
<ce>                         have any use for it.
