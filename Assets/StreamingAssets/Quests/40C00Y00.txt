QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                      You wish, %pcn, for power.
<ce>                 With it you can thrash at shadows and
<ce>                  have a hope. If I brought you this
<ce>                 hope, what would you bring me? Would
<ce>                  you destroy one who brings me pain?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                As I thought, no heart at all. We shall
<ce>                have no contract then, you and I, and,
<ce>                   disappointed, return I to my cold
<ce>                palace. The souls within are no kinder
<ce>               than those here, but there, they follow.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                Would you? You would be my anesthesia?
<ce>               You will go to the lair of the _monster_
<ce>                =monster_ at ___mondung_ and slay %g2?
<ce>                    Ah, %pcf, for that I would give
<ce>                     to you my _artifact_ which I
<ce>                have entrusted to my slave _qgfriend_.
<ce>                      After =monster_ lies dead,
<ce>                    go to ___qgfriend_ and meet my
<ce>                    slave at __qgfriend_. You will
<ce>                 recognize %g2 easily - a =qgfriend_.
<ce>                There you will receive the _artifact_.
<ce>                   And now, I must return to my cold
<ce>                palace of Oblivion. I will await news.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      No. You must be looking for
<ce>                        a different =qgfriend_.
<ce>                       My name isn't _qgfriend_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                           So, you're %pcn,
<ce>                        right? I'm _qgfriend_.
<ce>               I must say, I was wondering what kind of
<ce>                %ra it took to glide into a _monster_'s
<ce>                stronghold, murder the owner, and trip
<ce>                    right on out. Very impressive.
<ce>                  Nocturnal is likewise intrigued by
<ce>                   you, hence this gift: _artifact_.
<ce>                       Be careful with it, %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
=monster_ is a sneaky one -- %g brings the whole Mages Guild under suspicion.
<--->
I can't trust anyone at the Mages Guild, knowing =monster_ is a member.
<--->
Mages say =monster_ is hiding from Oblivion's wrath at ___fakedung_.
<--->
Mage's are gathering to scour ___fakedung_ for that scoundrel =monster_.
<--->
I saw a bunch of mages heading out to ___fakedung_.
<--->
I heard that traitor =monster_ is now hiding out in ___fakedung_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I knew =monster_ was in some kind of trouble, why else would %g leave so quickly?
<--->
The Mages Guild must have decided =monster_ was a liability to their image.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Well, I can't say I'm surprised about =monster_; %g3 past caught up to %g2.
<--->
I don't even think the Archmagister is sad to hear of the death of =monster_.

Message:  1011
_qgfriend_ is one of the regulars at __qgfriend_, just %di of here.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is a =qgfriend_ who haunts __qgfriend_. That's to the %di.

Message:  1012
_qgfriend_ is an agent of Nocturnal, operating out of __qgfriend_ %di of here.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is one of the slaves of Nocturnal, Daedra Lady of the Night.

Message:  1013
Nocturnal is the mysterious Lady of the Night, one of the Daedric Regents.
<--->
Nocturnal is a Regent of Oblivion, whose sphere is darkness and mystery.

Message:  1014
The _artifact_ can open any lock.

Message:  1016
<ce>                           %oth!  =monster_,
<ce>                     Oblivion's agent is upon us!
<ce>               I've moved the most valuable reagents to
<ce>                          to ___fakedung_ and
<ce>                  plan to meet you there after you've
<ce>                      dealt with that pesky %ra.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                                  N.

Message:  1017
<ce>                         A voice seems to echo
<ce>                        in your ear: =monster_
<ce>                      ...sure...special place...
<ce>                                news...

Message:  1018
%qdt:
 When I arrived at ___mondung_
 an echo mentioned a 'special
 place' inside.

Message:  1019
%qdt:
 I found a note from =monster_ saying that %g is
 expected at ___fakedung_ after trying
 to bribe me.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I now have a contract with Nocturnal,
 one of the Daedric Princes of Oblivion. I have agreed
 to slay the _monster_ =monster_ in %g3 stronghold of
 ___mondung_ in exchange for Nocturnal's
 artifact, the _artifact_. I must have the deed
 done and meet her agent _qgfriend_
 in __qgfriend_ of ___qgfriend_
 in =1stparton_ days or I will have failed the contract.
 This may mean something worse than just me not getting
 the _artifact_.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 =monster_ offered me _bow_
 in exchange for %g3 life, and I
 could not resist.  %g said that
 it is somewhere in ___bowdung_.
 Since I have already betrayed
 Nocturnal, I may as well try to
 find it.

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 =monster_ offered me the _ring_
 in exchange for %g3 life, and I
 could not resist.  %g said that
 it is somewhere in ___ringdung_.
 Since I have already betrayed
 Nocturnal, I may as well try to
 find it.

Message:  1023

 =monster_ offered me the _staff_
 in exchange for %g3 life, and I

 Nocturnal, I may as well try

<ce>                   Wait!  I know that Nocturnal has
<ce>                  sent you, and that she has promised
<ce>                   you the _artifact_.  But if it is
<ce>                  truly power you seek, I can top her
<ce>                  offer -- if you cease your attack,
<ce>                 I will tell you where to find _bow_.
<ce>                       Do you agree to my offer?

<ce>                       Prince Nocturnal will now
<ce>                             rest easier.

Message:  1040
<ce>                      Excellent.  I knew you had
<ce>                      a mercenary's heart.  _bow_
<ce>                      lies hidden in ___bowdung_.
<ce>                     You have only to find it and
<ce>                       you will be a power to be
<ce>                      reckoned with indeed.  Now,
<ce>                     I bid you good day, lest you
<ce>                      decide to claim both _bow_
<ce>                         and the _artifact_ by
<ce>                    killing me.  A mercenary heart
<ce>                      such as yours should not be
<ce>                           trusted too far!
