QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 I was wondering if you might do me a
<ce>                 small favor. You see, I have a friend
<ce>                  who requires a certain shipment of a
<ce>                 certain substance brought by a certain
<ce>                 time. I trust I'm making myself clear.
<ce>               Are you available for such an assignment,
<ce>             given a payment of, say, _reward_ gold pieces?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Well, I'm certainly disappointed.
<ce>                  I would've expected more enthusiasm.
<ce>                     Ah well, it's these times that
<ce>                 breed sloth and indolence, I suppose.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  So, you are available. Well, that's
<ce>                 grand, I must say. Now then, here's a
<ce>                       whatsamajig, a _item1_. It
<ce>                 needs to be brought to an alchemist I
<ce>                      know by the name of _npc1_.
<ce>                       You'll find %g2 at __npc1_
<ce>                       in ___npc1_. With luck, %g
<ce>                will have something for you to bring to
<ce>                        my friend, _npc2_. Well,
<ce>                        you best be off. _npc1_
<ce>                     told me %g needed the _item1_
<ce>                      in =1stparton_ days or less.
<ce>                   Thank you and have a good journey.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                We'll have plenty of time to chat more
<ce>                 once you've completed your assignment.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   %oth, I was wondering when you'd
<ce>                        get here. You are %pcf?
<ce>                            I'm _npc2_, and
<ce>                    that, I believe, is my _item2_.
<ce>                  If you haven't tried it before, you
<ce>                 really should. The effect is heavenly.
<ce>               Anyway, here's your _reward_ gold pieces.
<ce>                          Thanks a lot, %pcf.
<ce>                          You're a life saver.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I've heard that _npc2_ is a _item2_ addict, but I haven't seen any proof.
<--->
They say it's tough to concoct a good dose of _item2_, takes years of study.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
It turns out _npc2_ was a _item2_ addict after all. They caught %g2 buying it.
<--->
I wonder who was supplying that _npc1_ with the ingredients %g needed.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_npc2_ finally got that shipment %g was waiting for. He's happy as a harpy.
<--->
_questgiver_ seems pretty pleased with a %ra mercenary, but won't say why.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You did a fine job on that delivery, my friend. What can I do for you?
<--->
%oth, good to see you again, %pcf. You did a good job on that ... little job.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      As I recall, you failed the
<ce>                      last assignment I gave you.
<ce>                     I see little point in talking
<ce>                             with you now.

%qdt:
 I am bringing _npc1_
 of __npc1_,
 ___npc1_ a _item1_ in
 exchange for some item that
 _questgiver_ wants to be
 delivered to a third party.
 I have =1stparton_ days to accomplish
 the first part of this delivery.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 _npc1_ sent
 me on to _npc2_, the third
 party in ___npc2_, with some
 _item2_. I will recognize
 _npc2_ as the =npc2_
 in __npc2_, provided I get it to
 %g2 in =2ndparton_ days.

Message:  1012
<ce>                      Lovely, %pcf, lovely. Now,
<ce>                        here's the _item2_ that
<ce>                      needs to be given to _npc2_
<ce>                      over in __npc2_ in ___npc2_.
<ce>                          Don't dawdle, %pct.
<ce>                     _npc2_ needs it in =2ndparton_
<ce>                             days or less.
