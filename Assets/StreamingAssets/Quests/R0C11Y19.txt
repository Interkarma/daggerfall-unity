<ce>               I'm in rather a delicate situation, %pcf.
<ce>              If I could count on your diligence and your
<ce>                 silence, you could earn yourself, say,
<ce>              _reward_ gold pieces profiting on my misery.
<ce>                            Sound enticing?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        %oth, blast, and %oth!
<ce>                 I'm surrounded by apathetic lazybones!
<ce>                        Nothing personal, %pcf.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                Well, that's good anyway. Not long ago,
<ce>                during a time of financial stagnancy, I
<ce>                pawned a ring given to me by the Emperor
<ce>                  himself. I figured that Uriel Septim
<ce>                 never makes it down to this corner of
<ce>               the Empire, but now I hear his agents are
<ce>               in the area, and I must have to have that
<ce>                  ring back. _contact_, of __contact_
<ce>           in ___contact_, will only hold it for =1stparton_
<ce>            more days.  Here's the gold to pay for the ring.
<ce>                 Good luck and %god speed your journey.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                        My ring, %pcf? The %god
<ce>                    forsaken ring I sent you to get?
<ce>                    Where is it? If you've lost it,
<ce>                    I'll have your rotten %ra hide!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               Oh good, oh good, the ring. Oh thank you,
<ce>                        thank you, %pcf. Here's
<ce>                  the _reward_ gold pieces I promised.
<ce>                    An expensive delivery, but truly
<ce>                           worth every piece.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The Emperor's men don't make a big production when they come to town, I hear.
<--->
They're not very flashy; the Emperor's men could be here even as we speak.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I hear _questgiver_ did not have a very pleasant meeting with the Imperials.
<--->
For some reason, _questgiver_ is out of favor with the Emperor.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_questgiver_ entertained the Imperial statesmen in great style, I understand.
<--->
The Imperial statesmen were apparently very satisfied with their visit.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, hello, ring bearer. What can I do for you?
<--->
You helped keep me in good standing with the Empire. Now, what I can do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    The Imperial emissaries didn't
<ce>                 notice the ring was gone, thank %god.
<ce>                 Still, you are not one of my favorite
<ce>                        people right now, %pcf.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                    You must be %pcf. You're lucky
<ce>                 you made it when you did. I was about
<ce>                 to sell the ring to a very eager third
<ce>              party.  Well, if I understand correctly and
<ce>                         _questgiver_ wants the
<ce>                   ring before the Imperial statesmen
<ce>                   arrive, you better be on your way.
<ce>                   You only have a very little time.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_ has sent me to
 ___contact_ to __contact_
 where _contact_ is holding
 a ring _questgiver_
 pawned. I need to pay for the ring with
 the gold _questgiver_ gave me,
 and then get back to __questgiver_.
 All in less than =1stparton_ days.

Message:  1020
<ce>                     Give me the ring. This can go
<ce>                      easy or hard. It's really up
<ce>                       to you. Either way, we get
<ce>                               the ring.

Message:  1021
<ce>                      Fool. Now you will die. Did
<ce>                       you really think we would
<ce>                          let a witness live?
