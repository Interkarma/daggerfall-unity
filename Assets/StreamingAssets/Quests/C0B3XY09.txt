<ce>                           %pcn, my name is
<ce>                          _qgiver_. %god has
<ce>                        prophesied a great evil
<ce>                        growing in the heart of
<ce>                         a nearby dungeon. We
<ce>                        need you to go destroy
<ce>                         this thing. Will you
<ce>                                do it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       I have no time to spare.
<ce>                        I must find someone to
<ce>                          take up this quest.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      There is no time to waste.
<ce>                      Travel to the ___dungeon_.
<ce>                        There you will find the
<ce>                        _evilfocus_. Destroy it
<ce>                   within =traveltime_ days and all
<ce>                         will be well again. A
<ce>                        sign will appear in the
<ce>                       temple when this is done.
<ce>                        Return to me and I will
<ce>                             pay you well.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                          %pcn, you have the
<ce>                       thanks of all our clergy.
<ce>                             The evil has
<ce>                         been destroyed. As I
<ce>                     promised, here is _gold_ gold
<ce>                        pieces for your reward.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
__qgiver_ are very interested in ___dungeon_ suddenly.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The Evil is still within ___dungeon_, but it's changed its form.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
__qgiver_ destroyed an Evil within ___dungeon_ few knew existed.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You're the destroyer of The _evilfocus_, of course, I remember you.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
The _evilfocus_ yet thrives. I have nothing for you but scorn.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 A member of __qgiver_
 in ___qgiver_ named
 _qgiver_ charged me
 with the task of destroying
 the evil _evilfocus_ in
 the ___dungeon_. It
 must be done within =traveltime_
 days or the evil will be
 unleashed upon an innocent
 world. Or mostly innocent anyway.

Message:  1011
<ce>                   As you reach for the _evilfocus_
<ce>                 it transforms into a beautiful woman.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                      "What a tasty young mortal!
<ce>                       I see you came to destroy
<ce>                        the _evilfocus_. I have
<ce>                       a better idea. If I give
<ce>                      you this magic _magicitem_,
<ce>                       you go back to the temple
<ce>                        and tell them that you
<ce>                    couldn't find the _evilfocus_.
<ce>                      They can hardly blame you,
<ce>                        and you get to keep the
<ce>                             _magicitem_."

Message:  1012
<ce>                        "Then die like the pious
<ce>                            mortal you are!"

Message:  1013
<ce>  The curse is lifted. You should report to _qgiver_.

Message:  1014
<ce>  __qgiver_'s wrath will not
<ce> be easily placated for this betrayal.
