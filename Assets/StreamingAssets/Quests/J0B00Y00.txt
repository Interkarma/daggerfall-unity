<ce>               If you are available for employment, I may
<ce>                 have a job for you. It's a messy little
<ce>                  affair, involving punishing a thief.
<ce>               It will mean a _reward_ gold piece reward.
<ce>                 Sounds like something you'd be at all
<ce>                             interested in?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Disappointing. Well, we'll find someone
<ce>                           else doubtlessly.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                We seldom take a vigilante stand in our
<ce>                   affairs, but in this case, we feel
<ce>                 justified. This thief, you see, stole
<ce>                 directly from one of our caravans and
<ce>                is ransoming us for use of the highway.
<ce>               Such nerve. You will find the little thug
<ce>                    in a hideout called ___mondung_.
<ce>                      Be back in =1stparton_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    You had best move along, %pcf.
<ce>                     You only have =1stparton_ days
<ce>                          to kill that crook.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         Very good job, %pcf.
<ce>                     That ought to discourage other
<ce>                    highwaymen. Here's your _reward_
<ce>                            gold. Thank you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That footpad is single-handedly ruining the economy.
<--->
<ce>         They think that highwayman is a thief, but the crook
<ce>                    is highly trained with a blade.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That robber moved to a different hideout, but the roads still aren't safe.
<--->
I don't know why they can't arrest that highwayman. It ought to be easy.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The merchants are pretty happy that they finally got that thief.
<--->
I don't care that they got that nightblade. The roads still aren't safe.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Of course I'll chat with you, %pcf. I remember those highwaymen you killed.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
The Resolution continues to lose gold to those highwaymen. Not very amusing.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   You must be from the Resolution.
<ce>                     Prepare to die, bounty hunter!
