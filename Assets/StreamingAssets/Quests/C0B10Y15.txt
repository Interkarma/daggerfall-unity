QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                     %pct, __questgiver_ needs you
<ce>                  for a dangerous mission to retrieve
<ce>                    one of the lost _item_s of %god.
<ce>                    You will have to defy the power
<ce>                    of =lich_, its creator who then
<ce>                   betrayed the temple and sank into
<ce>                   evil.  He is now a lich, and still
<ce>                  guards the _item_.  Are you willing?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  I understand.  A lich is a fearsome
<ce>                   opponent for one of your youth and
<ce>                     inexperience.  Perhaps as you
<ce>                      mature you will take up this
<ce>                       again.  %god go with you.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  I admire your courage, but tremble
<ce>                  to think of the danger you are about
<ce>                   to face.  =lich_ guards his _item_
<ce>                   of %god in ___mondung_.  Remember,
<ce>                   there is no need to slay the lich,
<ce>                  just retrieve the _item_ and return
<ce>                       it to __questgiver_ here.
<ce>                     If we have no word from you in
<ce>                    =qtime_ days, we will chant the
<ce>                     Song of the Departed for you.
<ce>                    %god's blessings upon you, %pcn.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                I understand your reluctance to depart,
<ce>                    %pcf, but waiting will not make
<ce>                          the danger any less.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Praise to great %god!  I had not
<ce>                    allowed myself to hope that you
<ce>                        would actually succeed.
<ce>                     %god's favor will surely shine
<ce>                     upon you for this deed.  As a
<ce>                      small token of the Temple's
<ce>                     gratitude, please accept this
<ce>                          enchanted _reward_.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>        __questgiver_ hopes to recover their long-lost _item_,
<ce>        but who will they find willing to face the lich =lich_?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>            I hear that __questgiver_ now believes that the
<ce>               _item_ was never in ___mondung_ after all.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>         Did you hear about the %ra who went into ___mondung_
<ce>               and returned with __questgiver_'s _item_?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                %pcf, you are always welcome here after
<ce>                         you braved that lich!

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>              I do not blame you for failing to retrieve
<ce>                 our _item_ from ___mondung_, but I am
<ce>              disappointed that you accepted an assignment
<ce>                      that you could not complete.

Message:  1015
<ce>                A sinister voice whispers from nowhere,
<ce>                                    
<ce>               "The _item_ does not belong to you or the
<ce>                   sentimental fools of __questgiver_.
<ce>              I therefore reclaim what is rightfully mine."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                          The _item_ vanishes.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 __questgiver_ of ___questgiver_
 has sent me to retrieve a sacred
 object, a _item_, from ___mondung_.
 The catch is that it is guarded by
 =lich_, a lich.  I do not have to
 slay =lich_, however, just retrieve
 the _item_ and return to _questgiver_
 within =qtime_ days.

Message:  1030
<ce>                    This is surely __questgiver_'s
<ce>                           long-lost _item_.

Message:  1035
<ce>                     What?  You not only retrieved
<ce>                   the sacred _item_, but also killed
<ce>                  the evil =lich_?  You are truly one
<ce>                   of %god's favored ones.  You will
<ce>                     surely rise far in our order.

Message:  1040
<ce>                        =lich_ hisses in fury:
<ce>                                    
<ce>                       "You dogs of __questgiver_
<ce>                       will never have my _item_!
<ce>                        I made it and I will keep
<ce>                       it.  Nothing will stop me,
<ce>                          not even the grave."
