QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                   Thou art friend to ==questgiver_,
<ce>                          this we know. But to
<ce>                   help thee, a spell must be woven,
<ce>                    a spell that first must destroy
<ce>                     before it createth. Wilt thou
<ce>                       bring to us a _magicitem_
<ce>                     for our brew, so thou might be
<ce>                       blessed by its ruination?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Too employed art thou to do this
<ce>                   task, even knowing its importance?
<ce>                   Unfortunate for ==questgiver_, and
<ce>                      unfortunate for thee, %pcn.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                        The _magicitem_ we need
<ce>                   is held by ==other_. We require it
<ce>              before the day has dawned =1stparton_ times.
<ce>                  ==other_ can be found in ___other_.
<ce>                           Ask after _other_.
<ce>                   Let the gods and spirits guide thy
<ce>                              feet, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                        The _magicitem_, %pcf.
<ce>                           Hast thou forgot?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Ah, there is the _magicitem_ we
<ce>                  need for our spell. Quickly, sisters
<ce>                   rend it and rip it and boil it in
<ce>                     a covered tub. Here have we a
<ce>                       lump of _reward_ for thee,
<ce>                        %pcn, to thank thee for
<ce>                          thy speed and valor.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Remember that time when the Witches transformed our old %t into a snail?
<--->
The only thing worse than meeting ==questgiver_ is invoking their ire.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I heard a howl in the woods last night. I'd say the Witches are on a rampage.
<--->
Smell that sour smell in the breeze? That means ==questgiver_ are angry.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
They say ==questgiver_ have been celebrating the completion of some scheme.
<--->
You can get drunk on the smell in the air. A blessing from happy witches.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Dost thou like thy _reward_, %pcf? It suits thee, I think.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   Hast thou forgot the _magicitem_?
<ce>                      %oth, 'tis too late now. But
<ce>                  the ==questgiver_ art disappointed,
<ce>                          %pcf. Truly, we are.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                       The _magicitem_ you want?
<ce>                         Yours for a thousand.
<ce>                        Very good, here you go.

Message:  1011
She is a very wise woman of ==questgiver_.
<--->
She's a woman not to be trifled with from ==questgiver_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                        I ain't givin' up this
<ce>                          _magicitem_ for less
<ce>                         than 1000 gold pieces.
<ce>                        And I'm only willin' ta
<ce>                       do that for ==questgiver_.
