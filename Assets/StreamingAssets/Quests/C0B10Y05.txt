<ce>                            %pcn, we have a
<ce>                  very dangerous mission for you. The
<ce>                  temple has come into the possession
<ce>                    of an evil, magical weapon long
<ce>                   sought by the orcs. The temple has
<ce>                   already been attacked twice by the
<ce>                   creatures. It needs to be taken to
<ce>                   a safehaven. Will you do this for
<ce>                  us? The temple will pay _gold_ gold.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        I am saddened that your
<ce>                        loyalty to the temple is
<ce>                        so low. But in light of
<ce>                       the danger, I forgive you.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                         Take this _evilitem_.
<ce>                            In ___dungeon_,
<ce>                       you will find _custodian_,
<ce>                   a servant of this temple for many
<ce>                   years. %g will safeguard the item
<ce>                  and keep it out of the hands of the
<ce>                  orcs. We have bound it in spells to
<ce>                   protect you from its evil effects.
<ce>                  However, these spells will wear off
<ce>                         in =traveltime_ days.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         Ah, this is the evil
<ce>                        _evilitem_ that _qgiver_
<ce>                       spoke of. I shall keep it
<ce>                       here, where there are many
<ce>                       defenses to keep it safe.
<ce>                          _qgiver_ said that I
<ce>                       should pay you _gold_ gold
<ce>                       pieces for safe delivery.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The orcs have been attacking __qgiver_ caravans.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The orcs finally got that _evilitem_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The _evilitem_ is safe from the hands of the orcs.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I heard that you got rid of the _evilitem_. Now, what can I help you with?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I trusted you with the _evilitem_ and look what happened.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of __qgiver_,
 in ___qgiver_, gave me an
 evil _evilitem_ to
 deliver to the ___dungeon_
 so that the orcs could not
 get it. I have =traveltime_ days
 to make the delivery.

Message:  1011
<ce>                       You must be the bearer of
<ce>                       Manshrieker, the holy orc
<ce>                        weapon of war. Kill the
<ce>                        human! We must have that
<ce>                              _evilitem_.

Message:  1012
<ce>            The evil _evilitem_, sparks and disintegrates.
<ce>                      You suddenly feel very sick.
