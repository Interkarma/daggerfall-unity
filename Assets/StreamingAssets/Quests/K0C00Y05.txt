<ce>                 I've appealed to The Fighters Guild,
<ce>               but they apparently have their hands too
<ce>               full rescuing high-born damsels and lads
<ce>                in distress to bother themselves with a
<ce>                  low-born child's disappearance. But
<ce>                       my _child_ is all I have.
<ce>                    Please, you'll find %g2 for me,
<ce>                         won't you, my friend?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Those infernal orcs have stolen my
<ce>              little cousin and our so-called protectors,
<ce>                  The Fighters Guild, refuse to take
<ce>                       me seriously. _child_ is
<ce>                     just a =child_, not worthy of
<ce>                 their attention, but %g's all I have.
<ce>                  Please, good %ra, will you help me?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    A heart of stone, just like The
<ce>                      Fighters Guild. What is an
<ce>                  innocent child's life worth anyhow?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Thank you, thank you. I can give
<ce>                  you _gold_ gold pieces if you find
<ce>                        _child_ -- that's all I
<ce>                  have. Now, these orcs that took %g2
<ce>                  are the ones camped out in stinking
<ce>                      ___mondung_. I need to know
<ce>                        whether _child_ is all
<ce>                 right in =queston_ days or I'll send
<ce>                 someone else. Please don't reduce me
<ce>                      to that. %god go with you,
<ce>                              good %pcn.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        _child_, oh thank %god!
<ce>                       %oth, my good, good %pcn,
<ce>                    you are my savior. Here, here's
<ce>                       your _gold_ gold pieces.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_qgiver_ is quite distraught over the disappearance of _child_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_qgiver_ has given up ever finding _child_ again.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_qgiver_ and _child_ are reunited again, thanks to a %ra mercenary.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You brought _child_ back to me, %pcf. What can I help you with in return?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                     Don't you remember me, %pcf?
<ce>                          _qgiver_? You said
<ce>                        you'd get _child_ back
<ce>                     for me, but failed to. I have
<ce>                        nothing to say to you.
<ce>                            Go to Oblivion.

 _qgiver_
 of __qgiver_, ___qgiver_
 has sent me to rescue %g3
 little cousin, _child_.
 Apparently, %g is being held by a
 group of orcs in ___mondung_.
 I have =queston_ days to save the child.

Message:  1011
                             __knight_
                              ___knight_
 
 Dear %pcn,
 
      _child_ has not been
 kidnapped by any tribe of orcs or any
 such thing. In fact, %g is with us, as
 protection against _qgiver_,
 who is a notorious drunk. If you want to
 see for yourself, with your own eyes,
 come on over to __knight_.
 
                            Yours respectfully,
 
                            _knight_


Message:  1012
<ce>                   A courier bearing the heraldry of
<ce>                  The Fighters Guild appears at your
<ce>                      side. He hands you a letter
<ce>                           and hurries off.

Message:  1013
%qdt:
 I received a letter
 from _knight_ a knight
 of The Fighters Guild, who says %g
 has the child I am supposed to rescue out
 of ___mondung_. According to
 _knight_, _child_ has
 been taken out of _qgiver_'s
 custody because the =qgiver_
 is a drunk. If I want to see for myself,
 _knight_ is in __knight_
 in ___knight_.

Message:  1014
<ce>                 I guess you received my letter, %pcf.
<ce>             That's good. I'd hate it if you, for all the
<ce>               best intentions, got involved in a pretty
<ce>                       nasty situation. _child_
<ce>                   is _qgiver_'s cousin, all right,
<ce>                   but more importantly, the =child_
<ce>              is heir to their grandparents' fortune. For
<ce>                %g3 safety's sake, we've moved %g2 to a
<ce>                  place in __childlocale_. I suppose
<ce>                   I can tell you -- _childlocale_.
<ce>              You'll improve your already good reputation
<ce>               with The Fighters Guild if you just leave
<ce>                         little _child_ alone.

Message:  1015
<ce>                           Hi, I'm _child_.
<ce>                         I'm seven years old.

<ce>                    Hello, I'm not supposed to talk
<ce>                 to strangers. But if I don't talk to
<ce>                   strangers, then there's no one to
<ce>                          talk to. My name is
<ce>                               _child_.

<ce>                      Hello, are you a %ra? I am
<ce>                     too, and my name is _child_.

Message:  1016
<ce>                           _child_ runs away
<ce>                     when you turn away from %g2.

Message:  1017
<ce>                         Do you take _child_?

Message:  1018

 I have met with _knight_ of
 The Fighters Guild. %g told me that
 _child_ is being kept in safety at
 _childlocale_ in __childlocale_.
