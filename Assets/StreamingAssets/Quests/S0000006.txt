QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                      Hello, %pcf. I am Elysana,
<ce>               King Eadwyre's child and heir apparent to
<ce>                Wayrest. Perhaps you could help me out
<ce>               of a bit of an embarrassing predicament.
<ce>                The senior member of the elder council,
<ce>               my father's good friend Lord Castellian,
<ce>                has left court on holiday and I forgot
<ce>                to return a cloak I borrowed from him.
<ce>                If it isn't too much of a bore to you,
<ce>                 would you mind bringing it to him in
<ce>                    ___casfort_? I could offer you
<ce>                    a lovely _jewelry_ as payment.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                             No? Oh, %oth.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 How frightfully nice of you to help a
<ce>               silly girl like myself. Here's the robe.
<ce>                 Now, it's very important that milord
<ce>                Castellian has the robe soon. He is at
<ce>                     one of his houses, _casfort_
<ce>               in ___casfort_. Lord Castellian shouldn't
<ce>               be too hard to find, just ask around for
<ce>                   him or for _casfort_ and give him
<ce>                the robe. I do really appreciate this,
<ce>                       %pcf. It really shouldn't
<ce>              take you longer than =queston_ days to get
<ce>                      to ___casfort_ and back, so
<ce>                          I'll see you then.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                I know Lord Castellian doesn't have his
<ce>                 robe yet, and he's not a patient man.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Oh, how marvelous you are. Here, let me give
<ce>               you the _jewelry_ I promised you. I hope
<ce>             Lord Castellian appreciates the extra work I
<ce>               put into the robe. It is a real attention
<ce>              getter now. Let me give you something more
<ce>                  than the _jewelry_, %pcf. My father
<ce>             is very interested in a certain ancient relic
<ce>               called the Totem of Tiber Septim. He has
<ce>             spies all over the place looking for it. When
<ce>             they find it, my father will need someone to
<ce>             secure it. Obviously, whoever he chooses will
<ce>              be fabulously well rewarded. I'll give him
<ce>                your name. That is the least I can do.
