QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             I have a friend, a potential ally, who is in
<ce>             need of discreet assistance. It's a relatively
<ce>               simple salvage operation, one for which my
<ce>              friend would happily pay very handsomely and
<ce>              I would greatly appreciate. It will need to
<ce>             be accomplished very soon, within =1stparton_
<ce>            days. I'll go into detail, if you're interested.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>           Well, saying no from the beginning is definitely
<ce>          preferable to saying yes and failing. I am a little
<ce>                    disappointed, but that'll pass.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Excellent, I knew you'd help. Now then, my friend
<ce>                     is _qgfriend_ of ___qgfriend_.
<ce>        %g has lost a gem, a sapphire, and my spies have tracked
<ce>                it down to ___itemdung_, of all places.
<ce>                      _qgfriend_ needs this stone,
<ce>               because %g borrowed it from a third party.
<ce>             If it's not in %g3 hands in =1stparton_ days,
<ce>         well, there will be considerable trouble. Furthermore,
<ce>         the persons who now possess the stone will, according
<ce>            to my spy, be vacating ___itemdung_ any day now.
<ce>           Obviously, you'd best leave immediately to get to
<ce>          ___qgfriend_ in =1stparton_ days with the sapphire.
<ce>                    Good luck, %pcf.  Make me proud.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     The sapphire, %pcf? Have you
<ce>                       forgotten something? %oth!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Oh, %pcf, you don't know how
<ce>              relieved I am that you found that sapphire.
<ce>               I don't even want to think about it if you
<ce>              hadn't. Here's the finest reward I can give
<ce>                   you, a _reward_. Please accept it,
<ce>                        with my sincere thanks.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Those thieves in ___itemdung_ have some pretty powerful guards.
<--->
_qgfriend_ has been awfully nervous lately.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Apparently some powerful wizard has it in for _qgfriend_.
<--->
_questgiver_ has been complaining about the dearth of decent %ra mercenaries.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Turns out _qgfriend_ didn't steal that gem after all. They found it.
<--->
_qgfriend_ was called a thief, but they found the gem %g supposedly stole.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
My friend tells me that you got the sapphire. Now, what can I do for you?
<--->
I'm glad to see you again. My friend appreciated the little blue gift.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                     I'm impressed by your nerve,
<ce>                          %pcn. You failed the
<ce>                      quest and yet return with no
<ce>                               sapphire.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
