<ce>                    If thou wisheth the help of the
<ce>                         ==qgiver_, first thou
<ce>                     must help us. Will thou bring
<ce>                      us the three ingredients we
<ce>                       need to complete our brew?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Then get thee from our coven ground,
<ce>                    for ill favor follows those who
<ce>                      expect the world for aught.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   We witches need three ingredients
<ce>                   we cannot find to make our brew of
<ce>                   weather weaving.  First, a perfect
<ce>                       _item1_ from ___dungeon1_.
<ce>                    Second, search ___dungeon2_ for
<ce>                  _item2_, which will make the clouds
<ce>                  boil.  Lastly, the most efficacious
<ce>                      _item3_ thou must bring from
<ce>                     ___dungeon3_.  Bring us these
<ce>                        things in =queston_ days
<ce>                       before our stew doth cool.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       We need _item1_, _item2_,
<ce>                           and _item3_, %pcn.
<ce>                     We have not time for chatter.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Quick sister, take this %ra's load.
<ce>                           Mince the _item1_,
<ce>                         peel the _item2_, and
<ce>                          grind the _item3_ to
<ce>                  bits. Here we have three glittering
<ce>                 baubles we have no use for. Take them,
<ce>                   %pcn, as our way of thanking thee.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The weather has been predictable lately. The Witches must be sleeping.
<--->
One of those witches tried to come to town on business, but we chased her out.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Remember when the witches cursed our %t. Guess they're losing their spark.
<--->
It's said that the ==qgiver_ are losing their skills.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
You can almost feel the energy. Like the air is getting ready to explode.
<--->
Whoever says the ==qgiver_ are losing their skills is a doomed fool.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
For the _item1_, _item2_, and _item3_, I am at thy service, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  I asked thee for ingredients three,
<ce>                     but thou didst fail ==qgiver_.
<ce>                        Get thee from my sight.

Message:  1011
She's one of the ==qgiver_. Someone to be polite to.
<--->
She's a mighty prophetess, affiliated with the ==qgiver_.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 If I want to win the regard of _qgiver_,
 I must retrieve three items for %g2
 and bring them back to the
 ==qgiver_ in =queston_ days. The
 three items -- _item1_, _item2_,
 and _item3_ -- must be brought
 from ___dungeon1_, ___dungeon2_,
 and ___dungeon3_ respectively.
 I seem to have my work cut out for me.

Message:  1021
<ce>                      You have found the _item1_
<ce>                        that _qgiver_ asked for.

Message:  1022
<ce>                       This must be the _item2_
<ce>                         that _qgiver_ wanted.

Message:  1023
<ce>                      This looks like the _item3_
<ce>                         that _qgiver_ needed.

Message:  1024
<ce>  You offer up the _item1_.

Message:  1025
<ce>  You offer up the _item2_.

Message:  1026
<ce>  You offer up the _item3_.
