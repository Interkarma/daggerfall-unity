QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             If you are available for hire, I need someone
<ce>            reliable to carry out a certain, covert mission.
<ce>            It might be rather time-consuming, but I assure
<ce>             you that you will be suitably compensated. Are
<ce>                            you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Really? Too busy, perhaps. That is a shame.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Very good. I'm giving you an emerald for you to
<ce>                       give my contact, _npc1_ of
<ce>                    ___npc1_.  %g will be waiting in
<ce>                      __npc1_.  The item needs to
<ce>               be there in =1stparton_ days. That's very
<ce>                important. Once you've made it that far,
<ce>                        _npc1_ will have further
<ce>            instructions. I am counting on your discretion,
<ce>                     %pcf, and you will be watched.
<ce>                        Good luck and thank you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>           I don't believe we have anything else to discuss
<ce>                               right now.
                                     <--->
<ce>                            Do I know you?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Ah, good to see you %pcf. And the
<ce>          _item2_ too. Excellent. And here is a _reward_ gold
<ce>           reward for your effort and, I might add, for your
<ce>              discretion. Your name will not be forgotten.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>       _questgiver_ is still in the smuggling business, I hear.
                                     <--->
<ce>      There's been an extraordinary increase in smuggling lately.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>      I hear _questgiver_ is mad as hell at some %ra adventurer.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>     No one knows who the kingpin is behind the _item2_ smuggling.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>            Ah, my occasional smuggler. How may I help you?
                                     <--->
<ce>       Hello again. I'm afraid I have no more deliveries needed.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                Crawling back to apologize for failing
<ce>                 that mission, eh? Well, it's too late.
                                     <--->
<ce>                       You're the %ra who failed
<ce>                   that delivery mission, aren't you?
<ce>                            Go to Oblivion.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                Ah good. The last carrier _questgiver_
<ce>           hired never found me and we had to hunt him down.
<ce>             Most unpleasant.  Here's the _item2_. It goes
<ce>                         to _npc2_, this =npc2_
<ce>                         in ___npc2_. You need
<ce>             to get it there in less than =2ndparton_ days.
<ce>                            Good luck, %pcf.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ has sent me to
 __npc1_ in ___npc1_
 to deliver an emerald to _npc1_.
 I have =1stparton_ days to accomplish this.
 Once there, I may be given further instructions.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
 _npc1_ sent me
 on to ___npc2_ with a _item2_
 to bring to _npc2_ in a place
 called __npc2_. _npc1_
 described _npc2_ as a
 =npc2_. _npc2_ will
 give me my reward if I make it to %g2
 in =2ndparton_ days.

<ce>                    The Thieves Guild has word that
<ce>                     you are carrying a gemstone of
<ce>                    considerable value. Hand it over
<ce>                       and I'll let you off easy.

Message:  1021
<ce>                    Like taking coin from a child.
<ce>                     Now, get out of my sight, you
<ce>                          weak-kneed courier.
