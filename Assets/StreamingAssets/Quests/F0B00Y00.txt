<ce>                One of the more important functions of
<ce>                the House of Dibella is the preservation
<ce>                 of great works of art. We have scouts
<ce>                 all over Tamriel who look for rare and
<ce>                 beautiful pieces. Are you available to
<ce>                  retrieve one such masterpiece? It is
<ce>                 not far from here, and we will gladly
<ce>                  pay you _reward_ gold pieces for it.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  In over four thousand years of high
<ce>                 civilization in Tamriel, the House of
<ce>                 Dibella has worked tirelessly to save
<ce>                 and preserve objects of antiquity and
<ce>                  artistry from ruin at the avaricious
<ce>                   and uncouth hands of time. We have
<ce>                  developed a sophisticated network of
<ce>                 archaeologists, dealers, and couriers
<ce>                   who are goodly paid to procure art
<ce>                   for the house. Would you assist in
<ce>                       one such enterprise, %pcf?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     Alas, it saddens me that time
<ce>                     is considered too precious to
<ce>                       spend on that most rare of
<ce>                      all pleasures, true beauty.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                Oh marvelous. Now, the procurer of this
<ce>                particular work is a rather funny little
<ce>                            =contact_ named
<ce>                           _contact_. What %g
<ce>                  has found is apparently so rare and
<ce>                  wondrous, %g fears bandits will rob
<ce>                   %g2 before %g gets to our House. I
<ce>                  do not know how dangerous it is, but
<ce>                     if you would go to __contact_
<ce>                         in ___contact_ and get
<ce>                 the artifact from %g2, I would be most
<ce>                 appreciative. Time is of the essence,
<ce>                  for %g says that %g will abandon the
<ce>                  artifact if someone is not there to
<ce>               take it in =1stparton_ days. Meanwhilst, I
<ce>             will expect you back here in =1stparton_ days.
<ce>                     Fare thee well and may Dibella
<ce>                           lighten thy load.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       Hello, %pcf. You haven't
<ce>                      forgotten about the artifact
<ce>                        in __contact_, have you?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            It's beautiful! See how the symmetrical lines,
<ce>              the stylized figures, the delicate folds and
<ce>                   ornamentation... Oh, %pcf, what a
<ce>               gift you've given us with this icon. Your
<ce>           _reward_ gold pieces is certainly the least we can
<ce>                       offer. Dibella bless you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That quivering =contact_ is really annoying with %g3 conspiracy theories.
<--->
I wonder if that =contact_ actually has something worth stealing or not.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The House of Dibella acts as if losing that icon were the end of the world.
<--->
The House is so trusting, no wonder that %ra mercenary took advantage of them.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
After all those rumors, I hear that icon was just a forgery anyhow.
<--->
Wonder whether the House of Dibella is going to show the icon or just store it.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
What can I do for the %ra who brought us the lovely icon?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
When you failed art, you failed the House, %pcf. Begone!

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                 By Dibella, I've been a nervous wreck
<ce>                 waitin' for you to show up. Here's the
<ce>                icon -- I'm glad to be rid of it. I can
<ce>                  feel every cutthroat's eyes on on it.
<ce>                You better get back to the House before
<ce>                    they think you ran off with it.

Message:  1011
_contact_ is a common archaeologist-adventurer who works for the House of Dibella.
<--->
That =contact_ over in __contact_? Just some kind of thief or mercenary.

Message:  1013
It's a fake, I bet. But the House probably won't know the difference.
<--->
A forgery, in all probability. But very pretty, nevertheless.

%qdt:
 The House of Dibella has hired
 me to meet with an archaeologist
 who has uncovered an icon for them, pay for it,
 and bring the icon back to the House. This
 _contact_ is in __contact_
 in ___contact_. I need to have
 the icon back to _questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ in =1stparton_ days.
