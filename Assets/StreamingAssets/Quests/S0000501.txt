<ce>                  %pcn, I knew I could count on you.
<ce>                The friendship of the Queen of Sentinel
<ce>                 is reward enough, but I have prepared
<ce>                   some more tangible gifts as well.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>    _traitor_ escaped from the dungeons of Castle Sentinel, I hear.
<ce>          He was about to be executed for treason, you know.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>      _traitor_ was trying to get Wayrest to support his claim to
<ce>     the throne of Sentinel, but the _queen_'s agents got to him.
<ce>      No one knows what happened to him, but I assume he's dead.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I received a letter from _queen_
 of Sentinel.  She says that _traitor_
 has escaped, and she would like me
 to come see her about tracking him down
 again.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 _queen_'s spies have learned that
 _traitor_ is in Wayrest, stirring
 up trouble against Sentinel.  He
 is hiding somewhere in the dungeons
 of the royal castle there.  I am
 to find him and bring him back to
 Sentinel for execution in =time2_ days.

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 _traitor_ is my prisoner.  I am
 on my way back to Sentinel to turn
 him over to _queen_.

Message:  1030
Dear %pcn,
 
   I regret to inform you that your noble
 service to Sentinel has been undone.
 _traitor_ still has a few friends, it seems.
 He has escaped from the dungeon, only days
 before he was to be hanged.
   I would be most grateful for your assistance
 in putting this matter to rest once and for all.
 Please come and see me within =patsy_ days.
 
<ce>                             Your friend,
<ce>                                    
<ce>                          _queen_ of Sentinel

Message:  1031
<ce>               A stocky knight in the livery of Sentinel
<ce>                     stops before you and salutes.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                   "%pcn? A letter for you, personal
<ce>                    message from _queen_ herself."

Message:  1040
<ce>                Ah, %pcn, I was hoping you would come.
<ce>             My spies have located the elusive _traitor_.
<ce>               He has turned up at the court of Wayrest,
<ce>              of all places, apparently trying to obtain
<ce>             support for his pathetic claim to my throne.
<ce>               Wayrest would not be so rash as to openly
<ce>            give refuge to a convicted traitor to Sentinel,
<ce>             but he is hiding somewhere in Castle Wayrest,
<ce>            and I want you to find him and bring him back.
<ce>             Alive if possible, but kill him if necessary.
<ce>                     Do not let him escape again.
<ce>               You have =time2_ days.

Message:  1041
<ce>                    You again! %oth, will you give
<ce>                me no peace? I'll settle you this time!

Message:  1042
<ce>                  "Stop! Don't kill me! I surrender!"
<ce>                                    
<ce>                 Do you accept _traitor_'s surrender?

Message:  1043
<ce>                    The traitor _traitor_ is dead.

Message:  1044
<ce>                      _traitor_ drops his weapon,
<ce>                    and you quickly bind his hands
<ce>                     and blindfold him to prevent
<ce>                  any further trickery.  Now to make
<ce>                      your escape from Wayrest...

QuestTimeLapse:  [1045]
<ce>                  Then, by %god, we can die together!

Message:  1050
<ce>              Well, well, if it isn't my loyal _traitor_,
<ce>             come back to me.  Did you really believe you
<ce>                could escape my wrath? Guards, take him
<ce>                downstairs and execute him immediately.

Message:  1051
<ce>                _traitor_ deserved death.  I would have
<ce>                 preferred to execute him publicly, as
<ce>               an example to others of his ilk, but I am
<ce>          pleased that this sordid matter is finally closed.

Message:  1060
<ce>                 Did you think that you could dispose
<ce>                   of _traitor_ so easily? A Lord of
<ce>                 Sentinel is no one to cross lightly!

Message:  1061
<ce>                A knight in Sentinel livery approaches.
<ce>                   "I'll take this traitorous swine
<ce>                    _traitor_ off your hands now."
