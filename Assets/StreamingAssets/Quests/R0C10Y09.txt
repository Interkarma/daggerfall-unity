QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              Yes, I do have something for an able-bodied
<ce>               young %ra. It's nothing special -- just a
<ce>            simple errand, but it'll mean an extra _reward_
<ce>                        gold to you. Interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   %oth, I suppose you wanted me to
<ce>             give you _reward_ gold for nothing. Or perhaps
<ce>                  you were hoping for something really
<ce>                   interesting? Well, you'll have to
<ce>                          wait for that, %pcf.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Good. I have a ... procurer in my employ.
<ce>                       Distinctive looking, =spy_
<ce>                      going by the name of _spy_.
<ce>                     Well, _spy_'s found a special
<ce>                       _item_ of interest to me,
<ce>                 but the former owners have %g2 trapped
<ce>               somewhere in __hidingplace_. My hands are
<ce>                 tied officially, but you could kindly
<ce>                   go to __hidingplace_, find _spy_,
<ce>                       and bring me my _item_. Of
<ce>               course, if you're not back in =1stparton_
<ce>            days, your _reward_ gold reward will have to be
<ce>                forfeit. I'm sure you understand. Well,
<ce>                 you ought to be on your way. Goodbye.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      %pcf, you're back, which is
<ce>                    pleasant, but without my _item_
<ce>                    which is not so pleasant. Is the
<ce>                    assignment too difficult for you
<ce>                        to understand? Go get my
<ce>                               _item_ and
<ce>                             bring it here.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       Ah, marvelous. My _item_
<ce>                   returned promptly with minimum of
<ce>                   incident. Very good. Here is your
<ce>                         _reward_ gold reward.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
They're scouring __hidingplace_, looking for a rare stolen _item_.
<--->
There was a rare _item_ stolen from a private collection recently.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
They recovered that jewelry, and the guilty party was summarily executed.
<--->
The jewelry that they were looking for turned up eventually.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
They never did find that jewelry. The guards have given up.
<--->
<ce>            There was supposed to be some kind of rare gem
 hidden in that stolen jewelry.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, my young champion. Still in the mercenary business, I see. That's good.
<--->
What may I do for you, %pcf? I haven't forgotten what you did for me.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I don't see why I should do anything for someone who failed me, but go on.
<--->
<ce>                    Rather plucky of you to return
<ce>                   after failing to get my property.
<ce>                             I hate pluck.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>            _questgiver_ sent you?  %oth, when I heard you
<ce>             coming, I was afraid they had finally tracked
<ce>              me down.  I'm glad you found me first, %pcf!
<ce>                       Here's the _item_. Take it
<ce>                          back to _questgiver_
<ce>                  right away -- %g needs it in just a
<ce>                few days.  And be careful -- the former
<ce>               owner's agents are turning __hidingplace_
<ce>              upside down looking for this little beauty.

Message:  1011
I hear that =spy_ is over %di of here -- around _hidingplace_.
<--->
A nervous =spy_? I've seen %g2 near _hidingplace_.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
_questgiver_ of
 __questgiver_, ___questgiver_,
 has sent me to get a special
 _item_ from someone by the name
 of _spy_, who's hiding out somewhere in
 __hidingplace_.  The real owners of the _item_
 may try to stop me, but I must have
 the _item_ in _questgiver_'s
 hands in =1stparton_ days, or I won't get my
 _reward_ gold piece reward.

Message:  1020
<ce>               Thanks for your help, %ra.  We knew you'd
<ce>                lead us right to the _item_.  Now here's
<ce>                         your payment -- death!
