<ce>                       Are you %pcn?  The %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Very well, forgive the mistake.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Ah, good.  I have a letter for you.
<ce>                  Apparently more than simple chance
<ce>                           brought you here.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  You are a credit to the guild %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_noble_ is certainly one of the greatest nobles in %reg.
<--->
If anything were to happen to _noble_, I shudder to think.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The stars last night spoke of calamity and death.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The stars last night spoke of a disaster narrowly averted.
<--->
The Acolyte passed through town recently. I wonder what he wanted.

 Dear %pcn,
 
     Far have I come to speak with you on
 behalf of the Oracle, the wise woman of
 Hammerfell. The Archmagister of the Mages
 Guild has spoken highly of you as an
 honorable and talented caster of magicka.
 Please come meet with me as soon as
 possible; time is a circumscribed
 commodity.
      Without your help, the Oracle's dark
 prophesy will come to pass in =queston1_ days,
 and all %reg will weep.
      I must see you soon.
 
                     Yours cordially,
 
 
                     The Acolyte

Message:  1012
The Acolyte was said to be nobleman before he became the Oracle's disciple.
<--->
The Acolyte does all of the Oracle's footwork. Understandable at her age.
<--->
The Acolyte used to be a nobleman, but he is devoted to serving the Oracle.
<--->
The Acolyte is that =acolyte_ down at _temple_.
<--->
The Acolyte has been the Oracle's servant for years, since he was very young.
<--->
When the Oracle gives the Acolyte his prophesy, he will leave her at last.

Message:  1013
The Oracle has no eyes but she is said to be the wisest woman in Tamriel.
<--->
The Oracle has traditionally been the counselor to the monarchs of Sentinel.
<--->
The Oracle advised King Camaron against warring with Daggerfall.
<--->
King Camaron didn't listen to the Oracle's advice against warring with Daggerfall.
<--->
The Oracle knew that Sentinel would lose the war with Daggerfall.
<--->
If Camaron of Sentinel had listened to the Oracle, he'd be alive today.

 I got a letter from The Acolyte 
 asking for a meeting.
 He is staying at _temple_
 in __temple_.

Message:  1015
<ce>                      Thank you for coming, %pcf.
<ce>                The Oracle has foreseen the death of one
<ce>                   of the great nobles of __temple_,
<ce>                      the noble _noble_, and like
<ce>               a pebble in a still pond, %g3 death will
<ce>             lead to great calamity for %reg. I have tried
<ce>               speaking with %g2, but I am not permitted
<ce>                 to enter %g3 company in _noblehouse_.
<ce>              My mistress, the Oracle, intends to come to
<ce>                      __temple_ to speak with %g3
<ce>                Grace, and I last heard that she was in
<ce>                  __oracletemple_. I am not familiar
<ce>               with these parts, so I don't know how far
<ce>                away that is. I need you to either talk
<ce>              to _noble_ and convince %g2 to protect %g2-
<ce>                self, or find the Oracle somewhere near
<ce>               __oracletemple_ and bring her to see %g2.
<ce>       There is precious little time. Please, I beg thee, hurry.

Message:  1016
%qdt:
 The Acolyte told me that
 he is attempting to convince
 _noble_, to leave _noblehouse_
 lest %g die and by dying, bring
 calamity to all %reg. I have been
 asked either to speak with _noble_
 myself or go to __oracletemple_
 to escort the Oracle, the Acolyte's
 mistress, here. She might be able to
 convince _noble_, but, then again,
 so might I.

Message:  1017
<ce>                         You are %pcn, the %ra
<ce>                    my Acolyte sent to escort me to
<ce>                          _noble_. I gave my
<ce>                 eyes to the gods, you see, and I saw
<ce>                your approach through their eyes. Now,
<ce>                    let us hurry to _noblehouse_ in
<ce>                    __noblehouse_ before _noble_'s
<ce>                             fate is set.

Message:  1018
<ce>                     The Oracle speaks to _noble_,
<ce>               and her calm, persuasive tones work their
<ce>                magic. It takes only a few moments for
<ce>              %g2 to recognize the wisdom in her advice,
<ce>               and %g agrees to go into hiding for a few
<ce>                    days for the good of %reg. The
<ce>                Oracle thanks you for escorting her and
<ce>               tells you that she will recommend you to
<ce>                the court of Sentinel for your bravery
<ce>                         and resourcefulness.

Message:  1019
<ce>                      _noble_ and _love_ embrace,
<ce>                 and then %g pleads that, for the good
<ce>                   of all %reg, _noble_ must go into
<ce>                 hiding with %g3 most trusted guards.
<ce>                  At once, %g agrees, but not before
<ce>                   giving you _gold_ gold pieces in
<ce>                   gratitude for rescuing %g3 love.

Message:  1020
<ce>               As I told that blasted Acolyte, I am not
<ce>               interested in hiding my head because some
<ce>                mad old crone had a bad dream about me.
<ce>               As it happens, I am waiting for some word
<ce>                         about my love, _love_
<ce>                who was kidnapped. I will listen to %g3
<ce>               advice on this matter, but I will not go
<ce>                into hiding while %g remains in danger.
<ce>                 I should never have let %g2 go within
<ce>                     a hundred feet of ___mondung_
<ce>              without proper escort, but I will certainly
<ce>                not abandon my love now. There is your
<ce>                             answer, %pct.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 _noble_ refuses to go
 into hiding until %g knows
 that %g3 love, _love_,
 has been freed from %g3 kidnappers. If
 I rescued %g2 from ___mondung_,
 _noble_ might listen
 to reason.

Message:  1022
<ce>                       You've come from _noble_
<ce>                    to rescue me? %oth, let us make
<ce>                  haste then. I've had a terrible --
<ce>              and, I fear, prophetic -- dream about %g2.

Message:  1023
<ce>                     It is too late. The hour has
<ce>                    come when fate has won the war
<ce>                   with human will. The wind itself
<ce>                           whispers _noble_
<ce>                          is dead. %reg will
<ce>                               tremble.

Message:  1024
                    _temple_
                     __temple_
 
 
 Dear %pcn,
 
     It is imperative that I speak with you
 as soon as possible. I represent the Oracle
 of Hammerfell. For the next several days I
 will be staying at _temple_.
 There are but =queston2_ days before the future
 is irrevocably set, so I must see you soon.
     This matter is grave indeed. Please do
 not fail to meet me.
 
 
 
                   The Acolyte
