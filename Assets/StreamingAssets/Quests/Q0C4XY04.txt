<ce>                 ==questgiver_ must once again call on
<ce>                 thy kindness and might. We require a
<ce>                 heart of a daedra for our spellcraft
<ce>                    but the heart must be recently
<ce>                    plucked and by thou. Wilt thou
<ce>                     find and murder a daedra for
<ce>                           your dear aunts?

<ce>                       No? Oh, sorrowful night.

<ce>                    The Goddess smiles on us, %pcn,
<ce>                 for there is a dungeon near that has
<ce>                   a daedric infestation. Any daedra
<ce>                   heart will do but that of a Lord,
<ce>                   for theirs is putrid with worms.
<ce>                        Go thou to ___mondung_,
<ce>                           %pcn, slay for us
<ce>                   a daedra and bring it before the
<ce>                      sun sets =1stparton_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                           The heart, %pcn,
<ce>                           is in ___mondung_
<ce>                       in the breast of a daedra
<ce>                         Look not for it here.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Look, see how it still steams and
<ce>                            beats in %pcn's
<ce>                  bloody hand! Into the brackish soup
<ce>                  it goes, before it loses heat. Ah,
<ce>                         %pcn, take thee this
<ce>                       _reward_ for thy trouble.
<ce>                   Thou art good to us poor witches.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The daedra of ___mondung_ must be up to something. What a congregation!
<--->
%god has cursed us. Why else would the daedra have fallen on ___mondung_?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Praise %god, the daedra have left ___mondung_. I couldn't sleep for nights!
<--->
The daedra left ___mondung_ as mysteriously as they arrived. Good riddance I say.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
When the stars darken like last night, it is to mark the death of a daedra.
<--->
Did you hear music in the woods last night? The witches must be celebrating.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Friend to the ==questgiver_, how goes it with thee and thy _reward_?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   We had hoped for a heart for our
<ce>                       stew, %pcf. If thou wert
<ce>                  too busy, thou should have told us.
<ce>                    Plans were made that had to be
<ce>                    destroyed. Thou art our friend,
<ce>                       but still ... sad are we.

Message:  1011
_questgiver_ is a =questgiver_ and one of ==questgiver_.
<--->
She's one of the witches who makes her home in %reg.

Message:  1012
I heard that ___mondung_ is a vampire lair.
<--->
The night folk live in ___mondung_. They never come out in the day.
<--->
___mondung_? Isn't that an orc stronghold?
<--->
Undead wander the halls of ___mondung_. I'd stay away from it.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of
 ==questgiver_ has sent me to
 ___mondung_ to take the heart of
 a daedra from any seducer, daedroth,
 fire, or frost daedra I come across.
 The heart must be back in ___questgiver_
 in =1stparton_ days or less.

Message:  1040
<ce>                  You pluck a perfect heart from the
<ce>                        still-quivering corpse.
