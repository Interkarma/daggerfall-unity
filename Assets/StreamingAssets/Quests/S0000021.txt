QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                        %pcf, I am so glad you
<ce>                answered my letter. I hope my messenger
<ce>                   was gentle. You have been a loyal
<ce>                servant in the past. Not as loyal as my
<ce>                  living dead, but far more versatile.
<ce>                 My need involves the lowest depths of
<ce>                   Castle Sentinel, and the reward is
<ce>               knowledge that only the dead can provide.
<ce>                            Are you willing?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  You must have strong sentiments for
<ce>                      Queen Akorithi. What a pity.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   How amusing. I am looking for the
<ce>                 answer to a question. It doesn't exist
<ce>                 among the living, but may exist among
<ce>                 the dead. I want you to bring me back
<ce>                 the ghost of Prince Karolis, the great
<ce>                  grandfather of the late King Camaron
<ce>                  of Sentinel. Karolis was a sorcerer
<ce>                   of no mean skill. He is now a lich
<ce>                   deep in the bowels of the Castle.
<ce>                 I am giving you a special _scarab_. If
<ce>                  it is close to him when you destroy
<ce>                    his physical body, his soul will
<ce>                  be trapped in the _scarab_. Bring it
<ce>                   back to me, and I will tell you a
<ce>                      tale few mortals have heard.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Well done %pcf. I am sure the
<ce>                prince will be most cooperative. Please
<ce>                       accept this _magicitem_ as
<ce>                a token of my appreciation. In addition,
<ce>               I have decided that it is time for someone
<ce>               outside of Tiber Septim's line to know the
<ce>                truth about the Underking. As you know,
<ce>             Tiber Septim was the first emperor of Tamriel.
<ce>               Toward the end of his wars of conquest, he
<ce>              betrayed his Battlemage, Zurin Arctus. When
<ce>               Zurin died, his soul refused to leave his
<ce>               body. Something to do with the mysterious
<ce>               Numidium. Since that time Zurin Arctus has
<ce>                       lived on as the Underking.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                 The Underking and his agents have been
<ce>                 a thorn in my side for centuries. Just
<ce>               remember, should the Underking regain his
<ce>                 mortal body, he would surely throw all
<ce>                       of Tamriel into conflict.

%qdt:
 The King of Worms has promised to tell
 me dark secrets if I fetch the spirit
 of a lich. Not just any lich, but the
 former Prince Karolis of Sentinel that
 haunts the dungeons of the royal castle.
 I must destroy his body while carrying
 a special _scarab_ that will trap Prince
 Karolis' soul.

<ce>               Stitched into the zombie's decaying flesh
<ce>                     you see the following message:
<ce>                                    
 %pcn,
 
 It would be an honor to have you visit
 me in my demesne at your convenience.
 I have a small matter that you are
 ideally suited for. As always, my
 servants will test your mettle. Feel
 free to dispense with them. They can
 always be raised again.
 
<ce>                           The King of Worms,
<ce>                        Master of Scourg Barrow

Message:  1012
<ce>             The scarab given to you by the King of Worms.
