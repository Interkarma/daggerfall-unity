<ce>                  I recognize your expression, %pcf.
<ce>                 You are growing arrogant, egotistical,
<ce>                and vain. It's wonderful to see. Still,
<ce>                 you need to exercise your humility and
<ce>                  take on an assignment with dangerous
<ce>                   political connotations. We have a
<ce>                  contract on a high ranking member of
<ce>                  the Mages Guild. Are you up for it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Then strike that giddy grin
<ce>                        from your face until you
<ce>                         develop some bravery.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    You don't disappoint me, %pcf.
<ce>                   Yes, we have been asked to account
<ce>                   this wizard, who by the way is no
<ce>                 sparkcaster. To make matters a little
<ce>                   more interesting, this mage never
<ce>                 leaves the Mages Guild -- so you must
<ce>                   run the risk of disturbing several
<ce>                  dozen of the best, most destructive
<ce>                  spellcasters in the realm. You will
<ce>                find the sorcerer in the Mages Guild in
<ce>                        ___mondung_. The contract
<ce>                     is valid for =1stparton_ days,
<ce>                     and then you must be back and
<ce>                     this wizard must be dead. Fair
<ce>                   luck to thee and may her infernal
<ce>                    highness Mephala guide thy hand
<ce>                               and foot.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       The sorcerer still lives,
<ce>                          %pcf. Do not fail in
<ce>                            this assignment.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  The proud accounter returns, hands
<ce>                  drenched with the blood of the hated
<ce>                     wizard. You have accomplished
<ce>                        something now, %pcf. You
<ce>                    have a reason to be proud. Enjoy
<ce>                    your _reward_ gold pieces, %pcf.
<ce>                     And you can keep that grin on
<ce>                               your face.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Things are quiet at the Mages Guild. Makes me think of a sleeping dragon.
<--->
Sometime somebody's gonna do something about that wicked sorcerer.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                 Well, the mage left the Mages Guild,
<ce>              but I'm sure we'll see that scoundrel again.
                                     <--->
<ce>               Much more excitement than the Mages Guild
<ce>                 usually gets with that wizard leaving.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I think the Mages Guild is as relieved as everyone else at the mage's death.
<--->
If you ask me, that wizard was a bad influence on the Mages Guild anyway.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
That __mondung_ must have been a wretched place, %pcf. How lovely.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  You left that mage alive and still
<ce>                   you think you deserve my time. You
<ce>                     are egotistical indeed, %pcf.

 My latest quarry from the Dark Brotherhood is a wizard
 at the Mages Guild of __mondung_.
 The mage must be dead and I, back
 with the Brotherhood in ___questgiver_,
 in =1stparton_ days.

Message:  1011
<ce>                       You have slain the mage.
<ce>                     The Brotherhood will be proud.
