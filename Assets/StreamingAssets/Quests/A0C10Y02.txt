<ce>                 I am desperate. The Dark Brotherhood
<ce>                     has taken my child _child_ and
<ce>                    will kill %g2 if I do not pay a
<ce>                  ransom. I do not have enough to buy
<ce>                     %g3 freedom, but I can pay you
<ce>                    _money_ gold pieces if you will
<ce>                               free %g2.
                                     <--->
<ce>                       My child, my poor _child_
<ce>                    is gone, stolen away by the Dark
<ce>                       Brotherhood for %god knows
<ce>                  what hideous purpose. You must help
<ce>                      me, %pcf. I'll give you all
<ce>                      I have, _money_ gold, if you
<ce>                  will bring my child back home to me.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      This is a dark day for me.
<ce>                  _child_ will surely be slain by the
<ce>                    Dark Brotherhood. May %g3 ghost
<ce>                  haunt you for the rest of your days!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                You are my savior! My name is _qgiver_.
<ce>             Quickly now, for you only have =timeforq_ days
<ce>                 before they kill _child_. %g is being
<ce>                    held in _dbguild_ in __dbguild_.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   _child_? Where is %g? Why haven't
<ce>                    you brought %g2 back yet? If you
<ce>                      would save %g3 life, go now!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   _child_! You are alive and well!
<ce>                    %pcf, I owe you a debt that can
<ce>                   never be fully repaid. This modest
<ce>                     reward is the least that I can
<ce>                               give you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                   The Dark Brotherhood has gone too
<ce>                  far this time. Kidnapping _qgiver_'s
<ce>                         child is unforgivable.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                   I don't think that _qgiver_ will
<ce>                   survive the season. %g'll probably
<ce>                 commit suicide. You did hear that the
<ce>         Dark Brotherhood kidnapped and slew %g3 child, _child_?


RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                   You're that %ra that rescued baby
<ce>                         _child_! What a hero.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  The savior of my child! I thank you
<ce>                   and _child_ thanks you for saving
<ce>                       %g3 life. Bless you %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   My child _child_ is dead because
<ce>                 of you! Never darken my doorway again.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                 Are you here to rescue me? My name is
<ce>                         _child_. I don't like
<ce>                   these people. Please take me back
<ce>                             to my family.

Message:  1011
<ce>                         _dbguild_ is dark and
<ce>                      ominous. It is certain that
<ce>                        enemies lurk everywhere.

Message:  1012
On %qdt, _qgiver_
 told me of the heartbreaking kidnapping of
 %g3 child _child_ by the Dark
 Brotherhood. I immediately agreed to
 rescue %g2 from _dbguild_ in
 __dbguild_. %g3 family will wait
 =timeforq_ days for my return to
 __qgiver_ in ___qgiver_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                No one messes with the Dark Brotherhood
<ce>                               and lives!
