<ce>                Doubtless, you have heard of the crazed
<ce>                         wizard _wizard_. Given
<ce>                    the enormous power %g has at %g3
<ce>                          command, %rt %rn has
<ce>                been delaying any offensive move against
<ce>                           _wizard_, but that
<ce>                   strategy is at an end. The %t has
<ce>                asked us to send someone to destroy the
<ce>                psychopathic mage. In return for a magic
<ce>                  _reward_, would you do that for us?
                                     <--->
<ce>                        The people of %reg have
<ce>                been demanding that the Mages Guild take
<ce>                 a stand against the mad wizard who has
<ce>                been terrorizing the land for some time
<ce>                 now. Now, by order of the Archmagister
<ce>                himself, we are doing just that. I know
<ce>                 it's hardly the assignment a scholarly
<ce>                 institution should give, but would you
<ce>                   be willing and able to pay the mad
<ce>                  wizard a call and then hack him into
<ce>                                pieces?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Damn. I had hoped that we could count
<ce>                         on you in this affair.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Excellent. I knew that you would not let
<ce>                        us down, %pcf. Now then,
<ce>                        _wizard_ will be in %g3
<ce>                      laboratory, ___mondung_, for
<ce>                 at most =1stparton_ days before moving
<ce>                   on to a new location. The %t wants
<ce>               word that the mage is dead in =1stparton_
<ce>                 days, so do not tarry after doing the
<ce>               deed. I will see you in =1stparton_ days.
<ce>                     Thank you and good luck, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 I think you ought to be moving along
<ce>                 on that matter we spoke of, don't you?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Once again, you astonish me with your
<ce>                      skill and efficiency, %pcf.
<ce>                    An excellent job -- the %t will
<ce>                   be as pleased as I am. Here is the
<ce>                          _reward_ I promised.
<ce>                               Enjoy it.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The Mages Guild has sent someone to deal with that mad wizard in ___mondung_.
<--->
Everyone's just holding their breath, waiting for that wizard's next move.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Not even the Mages Guild could do anything about that crazed sorcerer.
<--->
No one knows where that _wizard_ is, but nowhere's safe until %g1's gone.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Hopefully, that's the last we hear of the mad wizard of ___mondung_.
<--->
It seems kind of quiet now that we don't have a mad wizard to worry about.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hello, %pcf. I hope that mad wizard didn't hurt you too much.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                       So, you're back, but you
<ce>                     didn't slay the Mad Wizard of
<ce>                         ___mondung_, did you?
<ce>                            Hopeless, %pcf,
<ce>                               hopeless.

 The Mages Guild of ___questgiver_ has
 asked me to slay the Wizard of ___mondung_.
 I need to have the deed done in =1stparton_ days
 in order to collect my reward.

<ce>                       You have slain _wizard_,
<ce>                     the Mad Wizard of ___mondung_.
