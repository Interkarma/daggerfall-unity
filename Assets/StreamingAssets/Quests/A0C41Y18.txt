<ce>                  for me, and I'm willing to pay very

<ce>                         Will you help me out?

<ce>                    %oth, I'll never be rid of this
<ce>                    thing!  Why will no one help me?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Thank %god!  You don't know how much
<ce>                  this means to me.  Here's your gold.
<ce>                Now, take this to _dummy_ in ___dummy_,
<ce>                 %g'll pay you the rest.  I really must
<ce>                   be going now.  Thank you so much!

<ce>                  _giver_ hands you a letter wrapped
<ce>                around a small object and hurries away.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                  The pirates have been particularly
<ce>                           active this year.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                 Have you heard the story of the curse
<ce>                  of the mummy's finger? Oh. Sorry. I
<ce>                           didn't realize...

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 Some brave %ra went into ___dungeon_.
<ce>                               Poor fool.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                The loons will be back early this year.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  Do you think I'm fat? Everyone says
<ce>                      I am, but I don't think so.

%qdt:
 I have been hired to make a delivery
 to a _dummy_ of ___dummy_.
 My mysterious employer paid me _gold1_
 gold and promised _gold2_ more when I
 complete my assignment.  No time frame
 was specified, but my employer seemed
 very anxious for me to be on my way.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 I have been tricked.  The supposed
 delivery to _dummy_ was actually
 a cursed mummy finger.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
 I have learned that the mummy whose
 curse I suffer is buried in ___dungeon_.
 I must destroy his true form or his
 spirit will continue to haunt me for
 1001 nights.

Message:  1013
<ce> Package? From _giver_? No, %g1
<ce> would've told me beforehand. You must
<ce> be mistaken. Why don't you read the
<ce> contents to see who it's for?

Message:  1015
<ce>     I wouldn't know anything about that. Try asking at a temple.
                                     <--->
<ce>              _sage_ knows about such things. Go ask %g2.
                                     <--->
<ce>         Have you tried asking around at __sage_ in ___sage_?
                                     <--->
<ce>     I hear that someone in ___sage_ might know about such things.
                                     <--->
<ce>      They say that _sage_ is the foremost expert in such things.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   Maybe that sage at __sage_ knows.

Message:  1016
<ce>                  He who stole my _finger_ must die!
                                     <--->
<ce>                        I come for my _finger_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                Accept your doom. Lay down your weapon.
                                     <--->
<ce>                       My _finger_, my _finger_.
                                     <--->
<ce>            You have my _finger_. Without it I cannot rest.
                                     <--->
<ce>          You may destroy me this night, but I shall return.
                                     <--->
<ce>              I will rise again to come for my _finger_.

Message:  1020
<ce>              All who violate my tomb must be destroyed!

Message:  1025
<ce>                    Let me see the _finger_. Ah...
<ce>                Yes, it bears the curse of =realmummy_.
<ce>                  Each night, for 1001 nights, at the
<ce>                    stroke of midnight the spirit of
<ce>                    =realmummy_ will visit the owner
<ce>                   of this _finger_. The only way to
<ce>                   break the curse is to destroy the
<ce>                    real =realmummy_ in his tomb at
<ce>                              ___dungeon_.

Message:  1026
<ce>                What you describe sounds like a classic
<ce>                mummy's curse, but without the _finger_
<ce>               itself, I cannot tell you more than that.
<ce>             Bring it to me, and I may be able to determine
<ce>                          from whence it came.

Message:  1030
<ce>               With =realmummy_ dead, you know you have
<ce>                   rid yourself of %g3 curse forever.

Message:  1040
Dear Stranger,
 
 I hope you will forgive me for what I have
 done, but I had no choice.  The mummy has
 haunted me every night since I found this
 cursed finger.  I've tried throwing it away,
 but it did no good.  A learned sage advised me
 that only by finding the mummy's tomb or by giving
 the finger away could I be rid of its hateful
 curse.  I am no warrior, and who would knowingly
 take up this burden for me?  You looked brave
 enough to endure the curse and perhaps solve it.
 Please understand, I meant you no harm, but I
 would have been killed or driven mad otherwise!

Message:  1050
<ce>                 _sage_ is a noted sage from ___sage_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     You'll find _sage_ in __sage_
<ce>                              in ___sage_.
