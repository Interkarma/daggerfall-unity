<ce>                         Hello. %pcn, I trust?
<ce>                      I'm _contact_. If you would
<ce>              permit me, a word of advice: Mehrunes Dagon
<ce>              may seem like a witless toad, but he isn't.
<ce>               He knows that the frost daedra is not yet
<ce>              dead, and you would do well to fulfill your
<ce>                           contract with him.

<ce>               you were promised. Enjoy it. I don't think

Mehrunes Dagon is the Lord of Destruction, the most violent of the Daedra.

Dagon seems like an ignorant brute, but he is really rather cunning.
