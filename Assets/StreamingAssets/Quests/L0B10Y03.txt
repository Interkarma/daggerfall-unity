<ce>                   The Brotherhood prides itself on
<ce>                   always knowing where each Brother
<ce>                   is at all times. I could tell you
<ce>                   where you were last Tirdas within
<ce>                 a foot of dirt. One of our Brothers,
<ce>                  however, has disappeared and while
<ce>                  on assignment. You will attempt to
<ce>                            find =target_,
<ce>                  and, unless %g has suitable excuse
<ce>                   for %g3 absence, you will account
<ce>                    %g2. I trust you have time for
<ce>                              this, yes?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  As you know, no one ever leaves the
<ce>                   Dark Brotherhood. One Brother has
<ce>                   disappeared on assignment, and we
<ce>                         must know if =target_
<ce>                    is dead or alive. You have been
<ce>                      picked for this assignment.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     Truly? Well, I suppose you're
<ce>                   entitled to refuse an occasional
<ce>                              assignment.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                          Good. =target_ has
<ce>                      a cousin in ___contact_ --
<ce>                          a =contact_ called
<ce>                             _contact_ who
<ce>                   generally can be found at a place
<ce>                        called __contact_. Talk
<ce>                  to %g2 -- firmly -- and find where
<ce>                %g3 cousin is. I'll give you =queston_
<ce>                  days to take care of this business
<ce>                              and return.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                            =target_ was a
<ce>                   vampire? Well, that does explain
<ce>                    things. If you haven't already,
<ce>                      you'll want to get yourself
<ce>                   healed at a temple, so you don't
<ce>                         end up in =target_'s
<ce>                         bloodsucking family.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Nobody, but nobody, doublecrosses the Dark Brotherhood.
<--->
=target_ supposedly went after some baron somewhere in %reg before %g vanished.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Some say that =target_ is dead. But others have seen %g2 ... at night only.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Funny, the Brotherhood offing that bloodsucker. You think they'd get along.
<--->
Apparently, =target_'s last target was more than %g expected him to be.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hello, %pcf. I hope you've had a priest look at you after that vampire battle.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                     I have nothing but scorn for
<ce>                   those who fail their assignments.
<ce>                        Begone with you, %pcf.

%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Dark Brotherhood,
 in ___qgiver_ wants me to track
 down a Brother who disappeared,
 and, if no reasonable explanation
 is offered, to do the accounting.
 This character, named =target_,
 has a cousin living in ___contact_,
 a =contact_ named _contact_.
 I have =queston_ days to find what
 this cousin knows, track =target_
 down, and get back to __qgiver_.

Message:  1011
<ce>                     I haven't heard from =target_
<ce>              since %g went off looking for that baron in
<ce>                     ___mondung_. Weird character,
<ce>               that baron. Never came around during the
<ce>               day, lived in that creepy place. It's no
<ce>               wonder someone wanted him dead. Still, if
<ce>                 someone was going to stop my cousin's
<ce>              career in the Brotherhood, I wouldn't have
<ce>                    expected him to be that skinny,
<ce>                              pale baron.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
 _contact_ told me that
 =target_ went to
 ___mondung_, looking for
 some mysterious baron for an accounting.
 ___mondung_ will be my next stop.

Message:  1013
<ce>                      "Let me share with you the
<ce>                    immortality the baron gave me,"
<ce>                           =target_ hisses.

<ce>                         The Vampire, =target_
<ce>                          is at last at rest.
