QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             I have an acquaintance, an alchemist of some
<ce>                    skill by the name of _chemist_.
<ce>               In order to complete a project of mine, %g
<ce>               needs a rather rare item -- the heart of a
<ce>              daedra. I won't lie to you; the daedra want
<ce>              this heart back, and you may encounter some
<ce>               of them along the way. Are you willing to
<ce>                risk this, in reward for a generous fee?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               I'm disappointed, but I can't say I don't
<ce>               understand. Volunteering for an assignment
<ce>              involving the daedra certainly requires more
<ce>               bravery and valor than is commonly seen in
<ce>                            %ra adventurers.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             You will? Then good luck to you. Here is the
<ce>               daedra's heart. If it is not in my friend
<ce>                 _chemist_'s hands in =1stparton_ days,
<ce>                it will be too old to be used. After you
<ce>               have delivered it, return for your reward.
<ce>                        Good luck and godspeed to ___chemist_.

--in 1002, added the name of the city you need to go to at the end.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             You don't think I know you haven't delivered
<ce>                  the daedra's heart to my alchemist?
<ce>               I hope you don't expect a reward for your
<ce>            obvious failure. Without a fresh daedra's heart,
<ce>            the project will be delayed once again. Blast it
<ce>                           back to Oblivion!

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Outstanding job, %pcf. I knew those
<ce>           daedralings wouldn't slow you down. Your superior
<ce>            skill has been duly noted. Thank you and here is
<ce>                    the =reward_ gold we agreed on.

--in 1004, changed _reward_ to =reward_ to ensure specific gold amount.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Dire portents have been read in the sky. The daedric stars glow bright.
<--->
The Cabal at the Mages Guild say the daedra are active tonight.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The daedra appear to be sated, from all astrological signs.
<--->
I could almost smell sulphur in the air, but it seems to be gone now.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Lot of activity at _chemist_'s shop. A big experiment in progress, they say.
<--->
_questgiver_ is very happy with a surprisingly reliable %ra mercenary.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
And what can I do for my brave young %ra?
<--->
Hail, hero. I hope you're not worried about those daedra holding a grudge.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  I was disappointed by your failure
<ce>                 to deliver that daedra heart. I expect
<ce>                 you thought I had forgotten about it.
<ce>                  That's the only explanation for your
<ce>                      decision to return to court.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>             Oh marvelous. An outstanding aortas daedrae,
<ce>               with minimal decomposition. Hurry back to
<ce>                        _questgiver_ now, %pcf.
<ce>                There's a lot on %g3 mind, and if you're
<ce>                  not back in =2ndparton_ days, %g may
<ce>                         forget you even left.

Message:  1011
_chemist_? Resembles a sort of =chemist_? I think %g's %di of here.
<--->
There's an alchemist named _chemist_ who works for _questgiver_ %di of here.

Message:  1012
_questgiver_? Why, %g's a noble. Involved in some daedric activity lately.
<--->
_questgiver_'s a noble, %di of here.
<--->
Like so many other nobles, _questgiver_ has about a dozen projects brewing.
<--->
_questgiver_ has a lot of faith in alchemistry, like a lot of nobles do.

Message:  1013
A daedra's heart. It never spoils, but some recipes call for it to be fresh.
<--->
The heart of a daedra. Not the sort of thing daedras like in mortals' hands.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_ asked me
 to bring the heart of a daedra to
 %g3 alchemist in __chemist_ of
 ___chemist_. This alchemist
 is a =chemist_ named
 _chemist_, and if I can get
 to %g2 with all the daedra trying
 to stop me, and get there within
 =1stparton_ days, _questgiver_
 will give me my reward upon my
 return to __questgiver_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                       The daedra hisses, "%pcn,
<ce>                      you meddle in affairs beyond
<ce>                      your ken.  Yes, your name is
<ce>                   now known to us.  And we will not
<ce>                      rest until the heart of our
<ce>                     brother is back in our hands.
<ce>                    Prepare to fulfill your destiny,
<ce>                               mortal..."
