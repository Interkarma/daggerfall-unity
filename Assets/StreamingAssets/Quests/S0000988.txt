Dear %pcf,
 
 You have probably not heard the fairy tale of
 Numidium, but you need to.
 
 The legend dates back to the earliest parts of
 the third era.
 
 Numidium was supposed to be a giant so big his
 hands could knock the moons from the sky. I do
 not recall from the stories whether Numidium was
 supposed to be good or bad, but the legends used
 to scare me as a child.
 
 The legends are, in fact, true. There was a
 Numidium, and, if situations continue, he will
 come again. The Totem of Tiber Septim is used
 to control Numidium. However, legend has it that
 great Numidium lost his Mantellan heart,
 whatever that is, in the final battle with Tiber
 Septim's Battlemage. Until his heart is found,
 the Totem is useless.

Dear %pcf,
 
 Numidium was Tiber Septim's secret weapon in his
 bid for supreme power: a thousand foot tall automaton,
 a golem or an atronach of sorts powered by a gem called
 the Mantella. The Mantella was infused with the life
 force of Tiber Septim's Imperial Battlemage, and with
 it, Septim crushed all who stood in his way. After the
 complete and total defeat of all his opponents, Septim
 began using Numidium to crush the neutral royal families
 of Tamriel so that he could enthrone only persons he
 knew to be loyal. His Imperial Battlemage was furious
 at this use of his creation, and fought to reclaim the
 Mantella. In the ensuing battle, both the created and
 the creator were vanquished: the heart they shared
 blown out of this reality into the netherworld they
 call Aetherius. Numidium's body was scattered throughout
 Tamriel and the Imperial Battlemage, without his life
 force went into a semi-slumber in a subterranean vault.
 In the centuries that followed, the Emperor's elite
 soldiers, for generation after generation, collected the
 pieces of the Numidium and became known as the Blades.
 Tiber Septim's Imperial Battlemage became known as the
 Underking, and sent his forces out to find the Mantella.
 
 Be warned, therefore. Those who search for the Totem of
 Tiber Septim are searching for the mechanism the first
 Emperor of Tamriel used to control Numidium. Should
 Numidium return, he or she who holds the Totem will
 control Tamriel's fate.

Dear %pcf,
 
 I must tell you about the Totem of Tiber Septim, which
 all covet. You must know the truth about what you are asked.
 
 The Totem was crafted by the original Imperial Battlemage
 of Tamriel, by orders of Tiber Septim. It is essentially a
 means of controlling a gargantuan creature called the
 Numidium. Without it, the Numidium would simply not
 function. The Imperial Battlemage placed a seal on the
 Totem so that anyone not of Septim lineage or possessing
 a special supernatural affinity, such as himself, would be
 instantly killed if they attempted to use it. The Totem,
 with the rest of Numidium, was lost during the epic battle
 between the Imperial Battlemage and his own creation.

<ce>       You approached by a young page who smiles in recognition
<ce>        and does not ask your name before he hands you a letter
<ce>         addressed to you. To all of your questions, he merely
<ce>                responds with a blank look and a smile.

<ce>             A letter is pressed into your hand. You spin

<ce>               the courier. As you take it, the courier
<ce>                     turns and walks quickly away.

<ce>             A redfaced courier startles you with a cry of
