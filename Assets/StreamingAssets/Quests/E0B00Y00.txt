<ce>             As a matter of fact, we could doubtlessly use
<ce>             someone like you. There's a desecrated temple
<ce>                     nearby called ___mondung_. You
<ce>              may have heard of it. For some time, it has
<ce>              been a home to evil, but we have ignored its
<ce>               influence. It is a counterbalance to other
<ce>              forces, after all. Now the balance has been
<ce>                upset. I need someone to right it. Sound
<ce>                  like something you could help with?
                                     <--->
<ce>                    The Balance in ___mondung_ has
<ce>             been unbound by a new intrusion that threatens
<ce>                our efforts at bringing harmony to %reg.
<ce>              We need a champion, someone like you, to set
<ce>                 ___mondung_ to right. Will you do it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Disappointing. Well, we'll find someone
<ce>                           else doubtlessly.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       Excellent, %pcf. What we
<ce>             need is to have a certain powerful lycanthrope
<ce>              who has established its lair in that unholy
<ce>                        ___mondung_ slain. It is
<ce>               threatening the expansion of our order in
<ce>               that area. If you are not back here after
<ce>               =1stparton_ days have passed, we will move
<ce>             against it ourselves, and your reward will be
<ce>              forfeit. Obviously, you had best be on your
<ce>                 way. Fare thee well and best of luck.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     %oth, that's good, %pcf. Now,
<ce>           there are but =1stparton_ days we can give you to
<ce>                  restore equilibrium in ___mondung_,
<ce>            and the fastest, most appropriate way we know of
<ce>            is for you to slay the lycanthrope who has made
<ce>                 its foul nest in ___mondung_'s bowels.
<ce>                 Pray hurry, %pcf. If you are not here
<ce>              when =1stparton_ suns have set, your reward
<ce>                            with be forfeit.


QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    You had best move along, %pcf.
<ce>                 You do not have very much more time to
<ce>                kill that werebeast. =1stparton_ days
<ce>                             to be precise.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              You have done a great service to the Temple
<ce>                     of Arkay, %pcf. One that will
<ce>               not be forgotten. Enjoy your _reward_ gold
<ce>                      -- you certainly deserve it.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I've heard there's some kind of werewolf on the loose around here.
<--->
I hear the wereboar's found a lair in someplace called ___mondung_.
<--->
Didja hear that howling last night? Wolf howling?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Lupines are real nomads, I guess. I hear our loup moved down south.
<--->
My cousin tells me that our wereboar was spotted down south aways.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear they found out that werewolf was a priest during the day!
<--->
A lot of people feel safer knowing that wereboar is dead.
<--->
You heard about that werecreature some %ra hunted down?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
How may I assist thee who restored the balance within ___mondung_?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You failed to slay that lupine, %pcf. I am sorely aggrieved.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of
 the Temple of Arkay offered to
 pay me _reward_ gold pieces to slay
 a werecreature lurking in
 ___mondung_, a former
 temple of theirs. I have =1stparton_
 days to do it and be back to
 ___questgiver_.

Message:  1020

<ce>                            of ___mondung_.
