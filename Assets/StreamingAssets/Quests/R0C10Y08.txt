QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                      If you could, %pcf, I am in
<ce>              need of assistance from someone I know isn't
<ce>              a complete buffoon. I sent another mercenary
<ce>              out to deliver a small package to a temple,
<ce>            nothing of great value, but damned if it wasn't
<ce>               stolen. Well, at least this idiotic hired
<ce>                hand paid attention to where the bandits
<ce>                   went. Do you think you could help
<ce>                     me out and get my parcel back?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 %oth, I was afraid you were going to
<ce>              say that. Ah well, I suppose that is better
<ce>                      than saying yes and failing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Thank you in advance, %pcf.
<ce>              Now, the complications. The bandits sold the
<ce>                    _item_ to a temple, _itemplace_
<ce>                     in __itemplace_. It apparently
<ce>               has some sort of religious significance to
<ce>              them. In order to avoid embarassment, I need
<ce>                   you to steal the _item_ out of the
<ce>                  temple and get it to _transporter_.
<ce>                  You'll find %g2 at _inn_ in __inn_.
<ce>           The _item_ must be in the moronic _transporter_'s
<ce>          hands within =1stparton_ days; and you must be back
<ce>            here from __inn_ in =2ndparton_ days after that,
<ce>          understand?  Not a lot of time. I'm counting on you,
<ce>                     %pcf. Good luck and farewell.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>              Yes? You didn't expect a reward before you
<ce>                 actually did anything, did you, %pcf?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   %oth, welcome back, %pcf. I don't
<ce>             know why I hired that mental deficient in the
<ce>              first place. Well, here's your _reward_ gold
<ce>                   pieces. You certainly deserve it.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Fearfully good to see you again. How may I help you?
<--->
You're the %ra who helped me with that unpleasantness with the temple, yes?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                        %oth, it's you. Come to
<ce>                  apologize for your sloppy questing,
<ce>                     I suppose. Well, don't bother.
<ce>                          I haven't the time.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                     Thank %god you arrived, %pcf.
<ce>                   Listen, hurry back to _questgiver_
<ce>                 -- %g will pretend to forget you ever
<ce>                 existed and you won't get a copper if
<ce>                  you're not back in =2ndparton_ days.
<ce>                      Believe me, I know %g3 ways.

<ce>           _transporter_ is a nervous-looking =transporter_
<ce>                   with connections to _questgiver_.

Message:  1012
<ce>                        You pick up the _item_.
<ce>                    Now to get it to _transporter_.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
_questgiver_
 has sent me to _itemplace_
 in __itemplace_ to steal
 a certain _item_, then deliver it to
 _transporter_ in __inn_
 at a place called _inn_.
 I have =1stparton_ days to make the delivery.
 Finally, I have to return for my reward.
 I have =2ndparton_ days to travel from
 __inn_ to __questgiver_,
 _questgiver_'s home in ___questgiver_.
