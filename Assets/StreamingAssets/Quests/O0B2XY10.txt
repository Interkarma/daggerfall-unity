<ce>                        _qgiver_. I have a line
<ce>                         on a _potion_. I need
<ce>                         someone to lift it for
<ce>                      me. I'll pay you _gold_ gold
<ce>                       to do it. What do you say?

<ce>                      =traveltime_ days, and I'll
<ce>                        pay you. That's not too
<ce>                           tough now, is it?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         Not bad, %pcn. Here's
<ce>                           your _gold_ gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_alchemyshop_ has some of the best ingredients in __alchemyshop_.
<--->
If you want just about anything, go to _alchemyshop_ in __alchemyshop_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
There was a rare _potion_ in _alchemyshop_, but it's in a safer place now.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Someone stole a bottle of _potion_ right out of _alchemyshop_. What cheek!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Sure, I remember you, %pcf. The _potion_, right?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  Don't tell me. You went all the way
<ce>                      to _alchemyshop_, found the
<ce>                       _potion_, and accidentally
<ce>                    drank it, right? %oth, different
<ce>                         thief, same old story.
