QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                I have a _item_ that's very precious to
<ce>              me. It's been handed down from generation to
<ce>                generation in my family. Knowing this, a
<ce>                small pack of orcish bandits have stolen
<ce>                it and are holding it for ransom. I have
<ce>                no intention of rewarding them for this
<ce>                 outrage. On the other hand, I will pay
<ce>              the full amount of the ransom, _reward_ gold
<ce>                 pieces to you if you would go to their
<ce>                   holdout and steal the _item_ back.
<ce>                               Will you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      %oth! You will not do this
<ce>                  for me? Then I will have to pay the
<ce>                    ransom. You disappoint me, %pcf.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Good. Now, I am given to understand
<ce>                  that the orcs' hideout is in the old ruin,
<ce>                      ___itemdung_. That's where,
<ce>                  I suppose, they're keeping my _item_
<ce>               as well. If you're not back in =1stparton_
<ce>                  days, I'll presume you haven't found
<ce>                 the _item_, and will give your reward
<ce>                money to the orcs as ransom. Don't fail
<ce>                      me on this, %pcf. Good luck.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      I don't want to talk, %pcf.
<ce>                      I want my _item_. Go get it.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Somehow I knew you'd find my _item_,
<ce>                       %pcf. I will happily give
<ce>                   you the gold I was saving for the
<ce>                  _item_'s ransom. I cannot thank you
<ce>                                enough.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There's a bunch of orcs hanging out at ___itemdung_.
<--->
Those orcs at ___itemdung_ are figuring they'll get rich off _questgiver_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The orcs at ___itemdung_ cleared out after _questgiver_ paid them off.
<--->
_questgiver_ is apparently furious at some %ra adventurer.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 A bunch of orcs are complaining that
<ce>                 _questgiver_ stole a relic of theirs.
                                     <--->
<ce>              ___itemdung_ is apparently as not as secure
<ce>                   a hiding spot as one might think.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>           Hello again, my young friend. I haven't forgotten
<ce>                    about the orc affair, you know.
                                     <--->
I hope you haven't spent all my reward gold already, my friend.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                         Go to Oblivion, %pcf.
<ce>                   I haven't forgot about you failing
<ce>                         that mission of mine.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
_questgiver_ of
 __questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 has sent me to ___itemdung_ to
 find an old family heirloom, a _item_
 stolen by a band of orcs. If I do not
 have it back in _questgiver_'s
 hands in =1stparton_ days, %g will
 pay the ransom, and my reward gold
 will be gone.

Message:  1011
You have found the _item_.
