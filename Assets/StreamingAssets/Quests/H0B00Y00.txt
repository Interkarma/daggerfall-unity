QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              The whole philosophy of the Benevolence of
<ce>                 Mara forbids us to harm another living
<ce>                creature willingly. We do, however, have
<ce>                a situation that unfortunately calls for
<ce>                direct and fatal action. If we agreed to
<ce>              pay you _reward_ gold, would you be prepared
<ce>                  to destroy an unclean spirit that is
<ce>                  haunting one of our sacred shrines?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  It is an assignment of considerable
<ce>                 danger, but I'm disappointed that you
<ce>                       will not even consider it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 There is an abandoned temple, not too
<ce>                   far from here called ___mondung_.
<ce>               It has been sacred to our Benevolence for
<ce>                centuries. We do not worship there, but
<ce>             we attempt to keep it free of evil influence.
<ce>                Unfortunately, the spirit that haunts it
<ce>                is too powerful for us to repel. If you
<ce>                  are not back in =1stparton_ days, we
<ce>               will assume that you have failed and send
<ce>               the Maran Knights instead. Obviously, your
<ce>                  reward will then be forfeit. Go with
<ce>                      the blessing of the Goddess.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       Why do you linger, %pcf?
<ce>                The spirit still desecrates our temple.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 You have done a great service to the
<ce>                       Benevolence of Mara, %pcf.
<ce>                     A favor that will not soon be
<ce>                  forgotten. Enjoy your _reward_ gold
<ce>                           -- you deserve it.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That ___mondung_ has always been creepy. Now it supposed to be haunted.
<--->
As far as I'm concerned, leave the haunt alone. No one goes near it anyway.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I wish they had just left ___mondung_ alone. Now the wraith's out here with us.
<--->
Typical. They chase the ghosts out to where they can do real harm.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
You know, even with ___mondung_ free of ghosts, I ain't going there.
<--->
The Benevolence of Mara's happy that their ___mondung_ is clean again.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
After trudging through ___mondung_ for us, the least I can do is say hello.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
___mondung_ is still cursed with spirits, damn you, %pcf!

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_ asked me to
 rid ___mondung_, a holy
 place for the Benevolence of Mara,
 of a haunting spirit of some sort.
 I have =1stparton_ days to cleanse
 ___mondung_ of it's haunt.

Message:  1020
<ce>                  "My spirit will now rest at peace."
<ce>                     ___mondung_ has been cleansed.
