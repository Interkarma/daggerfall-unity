QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    Our healer needs some sort of a
<ce>                   special plant, called _item_, for
<ce>                     his healing potions. I cannot
<ce>                     offer you much, but I can give
<ce>                   you the holy symbol of the Temple
<ce>                     of Stendarr if you'd bring us
<ce>                    some _item_ for our sacred duty.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Unfortunately, such is a common
<ce>                    response. We cannot offer great
<ce>                      piles of gold and jewelry to
<ce>                     entice questers. Nevertheless,
<ce>                     I am particularly disappointed
<ce>                        in you, %pcf. I expected
<ce>                           a nobler response.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  You have a kind heart indeed, %pcf.
<ce>                  The _item_ we need is at a place in
<ce>                     ___chemist_ called __chemist_.
<ce>                           A =chemist_ named
<ce>                         _chemist_ will give it
<ce>                   to us for free if you are there in
<ce>                    =1stparton_ days or less. Please
<ce>                    do hurry, %pcf. We have a great
<ce>                    many injured innocents to heal.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    I am always happy to talk with
<ce>                         thee, %pcf, but please
<ce>                       do not delay in getting us
<ce>                              that _item_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Is that _item_ you have, %pcf?
<ce>                   Oh, thank Stendarr. Please accept
<ce>                      our humble offering of this
<ce>                          symbol of our order.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The Temple of Stendarr is the only purely philanthropic order I can think of.
<--->
Mother waits for the healer at the Temple of Stendarr. Her condition is bad.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
My sister died waiting for that damned healer at the Temple of Stendarr.
<--->
I hear the Temple's healer couldn't get the herbs he needed in time.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
They had a few scary moments at the Temple. More injured people than usual.
<--->
The god Stendarr was watching over His Temple, that's for certain.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
It would be unkind not to speak with one who brought us the _item_, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I will control my temper, but didst thou forget the _item_, %pcf?
<--->
Perhaps you'd like to speak to those who died because you did not get the _item_.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                     Here's the _item_, %pcf. Now
<ce>                    hurry back to the Temple. There are
<ce>                    many there waiting to be healed.

%qdt:
 The Temple of Stendarr in
 ___questgiver_ has offered me
 the symbol of their order if I would
 find some _item_ and deliver it to them
 in =1stparton_ days.
 Someone named _chemist_ in
 ___chemist_ in a place called
 __chemist_ is willing to give some
 if I am able to get there in time.
