<ce>                     %oth, is there anything more
<ce>             exasperating than the discovery that the mummy
<ce>               wrappings you were planning on using in a
<ce>              potion have gone all sort-of green? I could
<ce>               use the Guild's wrappings, but the recipe
<ce>              specifically calls for "superlatively fresh
<ce>             mummy wrappings," whatever that means. I don't
<ce>              suppose you'd be willing to scare me up some
<ce>               cloth off a mummy I know has more wrapping
<ce>                     than it knows what to do with?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Recipes are a daft business, %pct.
<ce>               I'm working on a formula that calls for a
<ce>                  "goodly piece of =mummy_. What is a
<ce>                   =mummy_? An herb? A mineral? Well,
<ce>              I've researched the matter and found =mummy_
<ce>            is a mummy. Imagine that. And this particularly
<ce>                  mummy is right here in %reg. Could I
<ce>              talk you into going to its tomb and grabbing
<ce>            a piece of =mummy_ for, say, _gold_ gold pieces?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                           Oh, %oth. I know
<ce>                     it's not a swing by the local
<ce>                     general store, but I had hoped
<ce>                      for a little enthusiasm and
<ce>                          adventurous whatnot.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Jolly good, %pct. It'll be
<ce>                     worth _gold_ gold to you. Now
<ce>                    this mummy's tomb is not too far
<ce>                   away at all, so it shouldn't take
<ce>                 you any longer than =queston_ days to
<ce>                   get there, make your grab, and get
<ce>                     back. Remember, it's got to be
<ce>                   fresh -- preferably off its body.
<ce>                   The name of the place is something
<ce>                           like ___mondung_.
<ce>                    It's sure to be gruesome there.
<ce>                    You might want to bring a sword
<ce>                     or some such thing. Well, good
<ce>                            luck, young %ra.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Now that is a lovely piece of
<ce>                      wrapping. Thanks awfully. I
<ce>                    believe we agreed on _gold_ gold
<ce>                              pieces, yes?

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
=mummy_ in ___mondung_ is supposedly all that's left of an ancient %t of %reg.
<--->
=mummy_ was supposedly a %t in ancient %reg who was too wicked to die.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I got a boil the other day ... but it healed.
<--->
I just had a three hour conversation about the weather.
<--->
The weather is pretty usual for this time of year.
<--->
It seems a trifle coolish in %cn for this time of year.
<--->
It sure is a lot warmer today than this time last year.
<--->
My great aunt is going to a specialist across the Bay.
<--->
It's always funny what time it gets dark around here.
<--->
We should erect a war statue around here.
<--->
The kids these days with their magic. %oth, I don't know.
<--->
I had the weirdest dream last night.
<--->
I heard a great joke. %jok
<--->
%jok Actually, that's a joke.
<--->
%jok Can you explain that to me?
<--->
The legal system in %reg has it good points and bad ones.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
=mummy_'s reign in %reg began before the First Era and ended with you.
<--->
_qgiver_ finally can finish %g3 potion thanks to =mummy_'s contribution.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
How are you, %pcf? I hope you aren't coming down with mummy rot or anything.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                     I needed that wrapping, %pcf.
<ce>                  It's very annoying to need something
<ce>                            and not have it.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Mages Guild
 in ___qgiver_ has sent me to
 ___mondung_ to grab some
 wrappings off of a mummy
 named =mummy_. I have
 =queston_ days to complete this quest.

Message:  1011
<ce>                        You find the wrappings
<ce>                             that _qgiver_
<ce>                         wanted you to get from
<ce>                                =mummy_.
