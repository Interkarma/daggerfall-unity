<ce>                over by 12 foot long rats with poisonous
<ce>                stingers. I hear they can turn a man to
<ce>                      stone with a single glance!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                     _qgiver_ had to sell _house_.

<ce>                       I hear that _qgiver_ paid
<ce>                   someone to kill all the creatures
<ce>                     that had overrun %g3 _house_.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  You! You ruined me! I lost _house_
<ce>                 because you weren't able to take care
<ce>                    of a handful of monsters in it.

<ce>                  Aren't you the %ra that failed me?
<ce>                   I hired you to kill some monsters
<ce>                     infesting my _house_, and you
<ce>                     just couldn't do it. Go away.

%qdt:
 In ___qgiver_, I met _qgiver_.
 %g asked me to rid _house_ in
 __house_ of monsters. %g needs
 them gone within a day.

Message:  1011
<ce>  That should be enough.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You hear scratching noises coming from the walls.
<ce>  The creatures will most certainly react poorly
<ce>  to your intrusion on their territory.
