<ce>                       Keep your voice down. My
<ce>                      name is ... er, just call me
<ce>                           _qgiver_. I have a
<ce>                      guild job for you. Standard
<ce>                        pay. Interested so far?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Glad I didn't tell you any
<ce>                     details. Now get out of here.

<ce>                         You need to steal the
<ce>                       _magicitem_ from _mansion_
<ce>                           in __mansion_. You
<ce>                     have =traveltime_ days or the
<ce>                       deal is off. Did I mention
<ce>                       that the place is guarded?
<ce>                      Could have sworn I said so.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Got the goods? Ah! Well done.
<ce>                      Standard pay for this job is
<ce>                    _gold_ gold pieces. Don't spend
<ce>                          it all in one place.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_mansion_ in __mansion_ has an extensive collection of magical exotica.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
They moved the _magicitem_ out of _mansion_ for security's sake.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
That _magicitem_ was stolen from _mansion_. It's a real scandal.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Surprised to see me, %pcf? Thought I'd run off with the _magicitem_, maybe?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  They already moved the _magicitem_
<ce>                       out of _mansion_, %pcf. In
<ce>                 other words, you failed your mission.
<ce>                             Now, go away.
