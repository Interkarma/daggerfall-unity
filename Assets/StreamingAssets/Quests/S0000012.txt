QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                       Hello %pcn. I have heard
<ce>                much about you. Now you come to me with
<ce>               a very interesting tale of deception. So
<ce>               Cyndassa the maid says that Aubk-i opened
<ce>              a letter from the emperor addressed to me.
<ce>                  I can tell you %pcf, that she never
<ce>                    delivered such a letter to me.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                 I would like you to investigate this
<ce>                      further, %pcn. It could be
<ce>                 dangerous to poke into the affairs of
<ce>                 Aubk-i without enraging King Gothryd,
<ce>                     even though he is my own son.
<ce>                           Are you willing?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Aubk-i must have you tightly wound around
<ce>                       her finger, %pcn. I hope
<ce>              you survive to benefit from her patronage.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Good. I have long had my suspicions about
<ce>               Aubk-i's loyalty to the emperor. She is a
<ce>             daughter of the late King Cameron, who ruled
<ce>               Hammerfell from his citidel in Sentinel.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                My husband King Lysandus, %god rest his
<ce>             soul, died at Cryngaine, as did King Cameron.
<ce>              Lysandus body was not recovered, so he has
<ce>              a monument erected there rather than a true
<ce>                      tomb. Ah...my mind wanders.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                  The emperor uses _messenger_ as his
<ce>             messenger in Daggerfall. %g could be anywhere
<ce>              in the region delivering missives. However,
<ce>                    _messenger_ is a member of the
<ce>              Knights of the Dragon. Go to _location_ in
<ce>                 __location_ and ask for _dispatcher_.
<ce>                %g may know where to find _messenger_.
<ce>               Try to find out why a letter addressed to
<ce>                      me was delivered to Aubk-i.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            Ah! Now it makes sense. Uriel Septim addressed
<ce>            the message to the Queen of Daggerfall. When he
<ce>             sent it, I was queen. By the time it arrived,
<ce>            my dear Lysandus was dead and Aubk-i was queen.
<ce>           We must find out what was in that letter. I have
<ce>                         never trusted Aubk-i.
<ce>                                    
<ce>              Yesterday I received a letter from Princess
<ce>             Morgiah of Wayrest claiming to know something
<ce>            of the emperor's letter. Now there is a family
<ce>              that seethes under the rule of the Emperor.
<ce>               Return to me if you find out who has the
<ce>                           emperor's letter.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                For now, you have proven yourself to me
<ce>                  %pcn. Keep the _jewelry_ as a token
<ce>               of my gratitude. I have no desire to own
<ce>                     anything of Aubk-i's anymore.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 Mynisera, Queen Mother to Gothryd, has asked
 me to investigate why a letter from the
 emperor addressed to her ended up in the hands
 of Queen Aubk-i. The emperor's messenger,
 _messenger_, can only be reached
 through _dispatcher_ of __location_.
 Both are members of the Knights of the Dragon.
 She has given me a signet ring to prove my
 trustworthiness to them.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 Mynisera's signet ring bought the trust of
 _dispatcher_. %g told me that _messenger_
 would be in __palace_ at
 _palace_ in =2palace_ days time.

Message:  1015
<ce>              The letter from the Emperor? Actually %pcf
<ce>              this is rather embarrassing. The letter was
<ce>             stolen from me the same day I received it. I
<ce>              never did read it. I have been hoping that
<ce>             the letter would turn up, or the the Emperor
<ce>              would send another letter. If you find the
<ce>             letter, I would be most grateful if you would
<ce>               let me personally deliver it to Mynisera.

Message:  1016
<ce>              You should never have tried to investigate
<ce>                    the Emperor's letter %pcn. Now
<ce>              you will have to pay for it with your life.

Message:  1017
Kill the %ra. An ambush on the way
 to __location_ is your best
 chance. The fool intends to question
 _dispatcher_ there.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                                --- A.

Message:  1019
A signet ring emblazoned with the Daggerfall crest and Lysandus' personal crest.

Message:  1020
<ce>                          I am _dispatcher_.
<ce>              I would not normally tell anyone who is not
<ce>           a Knight of the Dragon where to find _messenger_.
<ce>             However, I am loyal to Queen Mynisera. I also
<ce>                   know that _messenger_ disembowled
<ce>               the last person that tried to ambush %g2.
<ce>             In =2palace_ days %g is due to be at _palace_
<ce>                     in __palace_. Try %g2 there.

Message:  1021
<ce>              Ho! You should be warned that I am a Knight
<ce>              of the Dragon in the service of the Emperor
<ce>              himself. If this is some ruse to ambush me,
<ce>                you will surely not live to regret it.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                  Hmmm. Yes, I am _messenger_. This
<ce>             signet ring proves that you are indeed in the
<ce>            service of Mynisera. Some time ago I delivered
<ce>              a letter from the Emperor addressed to the
<ce>              Queen of Daggerfall. If I am not mistaken,
<ce>             Aubk-i is Queen of Daggerfall, not Mynisera.
<ce>               Tell Mynisera that I take my duties quite
<ce>             seriously. I would never knowingly deliver a
<ce>             missive to the wrong party. Queen Aubk-i gave
<ce>              me this _jewelry_ in gratitude. Show it to
<ce>              Mynisera so that she may know I am a loyal
<ce>                   servant and faithful to my Order.
