<ce>                        The ==qgiver_ actually
<ce>                   could use thy assistance in a most
<ce>                  absurd and yet serious matter. Thou
<ce>                 hast no illusions that the witches of
<ce>                        %reg are despised. None
<ce>                  trust us for long, for our power and
<ce>                 solitude make us a difficult force to
<ce>                 manipulate. We have discovered a trap
<ce>                  that will soon be sprung on us, and
<ce>                  we need someone like thee to disable
<ce>                   it. Art thou interested in such a
<ce>                    quest, in exchange for a _gem_?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                         Wilt thou not? %oth,
<ce>                        the ==qgiver_ is used to
<ce>                      the cowardice of our allies.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Thou wilt? Take then this child,
<ce>                        _child_ %g says %g3 name
<ce>                is. We found %g2 some days ago abandoned
<ce>               by %g3 people. Clearly, %g has been placed
<ce>               here so our enemies can prove that we are
<ce>               involved in -- what do you suppose? Human
<ce>                sacrifice? The corruption of innocents?
<ce>              Nothing so mundane as kidnapping I'd wager.
<ce>                       _child_ tells us that %g3
<ce>                   parents live at _home_ in __home_.
<ce>               Lead the child back, but beware. Our fine
<ce>                 enemies would rather murder the two of
<ce>                ye than allow the child to return home.
<ce>               Come back to us in =queston_ days or less
<ce>                        and we'll have thy _gem_
<ce>                          for thee. Good luck.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        It is good that _child_
<ce>                   is home. Perhaps the kindness that
<ce>                          the ==qgiver_ showed
<ce>                  will dispel some of the myths of our
<ce>                 iniquity for the next generation. Here
<ce>                          is thy _gem_. Thanks
<ce>                           be to thee, %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
==qgiver_ are whispered to be much worse than kidnappers.
<--->
If that _child_ isn't found, ==qgiver_ will burn.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
==qgiver_, they say, kidnapped a =child_. Poor thing.
<--->
==qgiver_ can't disprove that they kidnapped a child.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
==qgiver_ didn't kidnap _child_ -- %g %g3-self says they didn't.
<--->
If you can trust _child_'s word, %g was helped not hurt by ==qgiver_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
For thy kindness to _child_ and the ==qgiver_, I'm happy to talk with thee.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    We asked thou to escort little
<ce>                         _child_ to %g3 house,
<ce>                    but thou didst fail. 'Twasn't an
<ce>                idle request, nor are the recriminations
<ce>                         mild. Leave ==qgiver_
<ce>                            now, cursed %ra.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 I am bringing a child who was abandoned
 at the coven of =qgiver_ back home.
 _child_, the child,
 lives in _home_ in __home_.
 The witches' enemies, I'm told, would
 sooner kill us than let the child
 return home safely. I should
 then return to ___qgiver_ for my
 reward from _qgiver_.

Message:  1011
<ce>                    "This is where I live! This is
<ce>                           my home!" _child_
<ce>                     gives you a kiss on the cheek,
<ce>                           "Thank you, %pcf!"

Message:  1012
<ce>                        "Witch lover! Child of
<ce>                           _daedra_!" a voice
<ce>                                shrieks.
                                     <--->

<ce>                       to live!" someone screams.

<ce>                          "%god strengthen my
<ce>                     hand against the pawn and the
<ce>                      child of the infernal ones,
<ce>                           the ==qgiver_!" a
<ce>                              voice cries.

Message:  1013
<ce>                     "I'll go the rest of the way
<ce>                   myself," says the child, slipping
<ce>                       away and disappearing with
<ce>                          surprising agility.
