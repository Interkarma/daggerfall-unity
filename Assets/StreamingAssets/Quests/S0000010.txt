<ce>                      Good day, %pcf. My name is
<ce>                     _agentuk_. I must admit that
<ce>              I am surprised to see you. Are you perhaps
<ce>               able to help the Underking in an endeavor
<ce>               against the Necromancers? We will reward
<ce>              you liberally for this service, and provide
<ce>               information you will probably not be able
<ce>                          to find elsewhere.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                         No. I see. Very well.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>              You will. Hmm. Remarkable. The Necromancers
<ce>                have taken an item of ours, a _reward_
<ce>               of some value. The value is of secondary
<ce>             concern. The true problem is that they cursed
<ce>              this item and gave it to the Blades. If you
<ce>              are unaware, the Blades were once the honor
<ce>             guard for Tiber Septim. Today they are loyal
<ce>                to the empire and Tiber's code, but not
<ce>             always to the current emperor. The Underking
<ce>             has reason to not wish harm upon the Blades.
<ce>               We want you to infiltrate Castle Llugwych
<ce>                  in Ykalon and remove the _reward_.
<ce>             Please have this done in =itemindung_ days if
<ce>                 you want your information and reward.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       No _reward_, as they say,
<ce>                         no information, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Well done, %pcf. Let me cast
<ce>                     this spell upon the _reward_
<ce>                    ... there. The _reward_ is now
<ce>                        safe and yours to keep.
<ce>                                    
<ce>               Not even death can hide a true descendant
<ce>               of Tiber Septim from the Underking. King
<ce>                 Lysandus did not die in the battle of
<ce>              Cryngaine. He was slain by treachery before
<ce>              it. The monument to him in Hammerfell is an
<ce>                 empty tomb. His remains were secretly
<ce>              taken to an ancient tomb in Menevia, which
<ce>                I will now reveal to you. I do not know
<ce>               who betrayed Lysandus, nor why his spirit
<ce>               haunts the city of Daggerfall and not the
<ce>               battlefield of Cryngaine. I have kept my
<ce>               part of the bargain, and you have earned
<ce>                    the gratitude of the Underking.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The King of Worms and the Underking are supposed to be one and the same.
<--->
The Underking is supposedly dead, but his agents still carry out his goals.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Stealing from the Underking is a lunatic's profession. Ask that %ra mercenary.
<--->
Did you hear about the %ra who tried to steal from the Underking? Poor idiot.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Strange portents were in the stars last night. Angry passions of a demi-god.
<--->
Necromancers are supposedly scouring the countryside looking for a _reward_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
%qdt:
 An agent of the Underking has sent me to
 Castle Llugwych in Ykalon to find a certain
 _reward_ the Necromancers stole from
 the Underking. I have =itemindung_ days to find
 and return the _reward_.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>               You interfere with the plans of The King
<ce>                 of Worms. Fear for your mortal life!
                                     <--->
<ce>                The King of Worms demands vengence. You
<ce>                stole what was rightfully his. Now you
<ce>                  must join the kingdom of the dead.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 Foolish flesh and blood. Do not defy
<ce>                the Lord of the Dead. The King of Worms
<ce>                        will have his vengence.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  You should never have touched that
<ce>                     _reward_. It is a gateway to
<ce>                the land of the dead. Now you must join
<ce>                       us there. Prepare to die!

Message:  1021
Dear %pcn,
 
    Queen Akorithi of Sentinel spoke highly of you as a
 brave, able, and unprejudiced %ra. Her actual
 words were 'a hero.' For some time, we have been
 looking for someone like that.
    I will not lie to you about our loyalties. We
 serve the Underking. If you are a believer in fairy
 tales and consider the Underking the ultimate force of
 evil, we apologize for misjudging you. Otherwise, we
 need your help. You can find me at _agentplace_
 of __agentplace_ in Sentinel. I will wait one month.

Message:  1022
<ce>                   A young courier drily hands you a
<ce>                  letter and then stalks off without
<ce>                            saying a word.
