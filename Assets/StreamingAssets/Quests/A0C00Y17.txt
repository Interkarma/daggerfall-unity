RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   I guess I'll have to find someone
<ce>                   else to protect me on my journey.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       Blessings upon you, %pcn.
<ce>                  I travel light, so I'm ready to go.
<ce>                    I know you don't work for free.
<ce>                      Take me to _destination_ in

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        Ah! _destination_! You
<ce>                    have fulfilled your part of the
<ce>                      bargain. Here is the gold I
<ce>                             promised you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                   I hear the guards are looking for
<ce>                 _questgiver_. %g had to flee the town.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 Don't you know? The Thieves Guild is
<ce>                   after _questgiver_. Or was it the
<ce>                      Dark Brotherhood? I forget.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     I heard _questgiver_ has been
<ce>                   forced to marry. %g has to get to
<ce>                       __destination_ before the
<ce>                       pregnancy begins to show.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                     They caught _questgiver_. %g
<ce>                      will stand trial next week.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                    Did you hear? Some %ra smuggled
<ce>                     _questgiver_ out of town just
<ce>                   in time. Otherwise they would have
<ce>                         beheaded %g2 for sure.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                   Thanks for getting me out of that
<ce>                     town, %pcf. I have recommended
<ce>                     you to several of my friends.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    You! Because you wouldn't help
<ce>                    me get out of town, the Thieves
<ce>                      Guild took my shop! Go away.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 I met _questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_. %g
 will pay me to escort %g2 to
 _destination_ in __destination_.
 In particular, %g needs to get to _destination_
 within =traveltime_ days.

Message:  1019
<ce>                        _questgiver_ says, "Ha!
<ce>                     I hired this %ra to protect me
<ce>                        from this. %pcn, are you
<ce>                        going to turn me over?"

Message:  1020
<ce>                    Halt! I have a warrant for the
<ce>                     arrest of _questgiver_ in the
<ce>                    name of %reg. We don't want you,
<ce>                    just %g2. Turn %g2 over and you
<ce>                              can go free.

Message:  1021
<ce>                   There is no need for us to fight.
<ce>                   Our quarrel is with _questgiver_.
<ce>                    The Mages Guild does not accept
<ce>                     treachery lightly. Give %g2 to
<ce>                     us and you can be on your way.

Message:  1022
<ce>                      Out of the way, %ra. We want
<ce>                         _questgiver_, and you
<ce>                   can't stop us. Just turn %g2 over.
<ce>                         Hey, _questgiver_. You
<ce>                    didn't think you could cheat the
<ce>                    Thieves Guild and live, did you?

Message:  1023
<ce>                           Stand aside, %ra.
<ce>                       _questgiver_ is wanted by
<ce>                       the Dark Brotherhood. You
<ce>                      aren't such a fool as to try
<ce>                        to protect %g2, are you?

Message:  1030
<ce>                         _questgiver_ is slain
<ce>                        right before your eyes.

Message:  1040
<ce>                  Have it your way. Kill them both!

Message:  1050
<ce>                          Are you lost, %pcn?
<ce>                      I guess I'll have to find my
<ce>                       own way to __destination_.
<ce>                     Thanks for nothing, worthless
<ce>                                wretch.
