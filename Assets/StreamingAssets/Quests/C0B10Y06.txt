<ce>                 They tell me that you quite loyal to
<ce>                 the temple. I need you perform a vital
<ce>                   task for us. %god has become angry
<ce>                 with us. You need not concern yourself
<ce>                  with why. Our only hope is to hold a
<ce>                rite of atonement. We need _ingredient_
<ce>                  for the ceremony. My sources tell me
<ce>                 that some can be found in ___dungeon_.
<ce>                        Will you bring it to us?

<ce>                      Your loyalty to the temple
<ce>                        is not what I thought it
<ce>                               was, %pcn.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       The ceremony must be held
<ce>                     within =traveltime_ days. The
<ce>                         temple will reward you
<ce>                       with _gold_ gold for this.
<ce>                      Only untainted _ingredient_
<ce>                        will do. %god's blessing
<ce>                        is upon you so that you
<ce>                         will know it when you
<ce>                                find it.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      You have it? _ingredient_!
<ce>                         %god will be pacified.
<ce>                      You have done well. Here is
<ce>                              your reward.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Things have been rather ... tense around __qgiver_ lately.
<--->
There was supposedly an unauthorized orgy in __qgiver_.
<--->
Someone spoke %god's name backwards in a ceremony at __qgiver_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
__qgiver_ is still out of favor with their god.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
__qgiver_ is back in favor with their god.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You have pacified %god, %pct. Of course, how can I help you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
While %god hates __qgiver_, I shall hate thee, %pct.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of __qgiver_,
 in ___qgiver_, told me that %g3 god was
 angered. %g needs untainted
 _ingredient_ from ___dungeon_
 for a rite of atonement. It
 must be in _qgiver_'s
 hands at __qgiver_
 within =traveltime_ days.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      This is it! I can feel the
<ce>                      purity of the _ingredient_.
<ce>                         Now to get it back to
<ce>                               _qgiver_.
