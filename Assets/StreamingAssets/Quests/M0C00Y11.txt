<ce>                       You can call me _qgiver_.
<ce>             Normally we only give jobs to guild members.
<ce>              But you show promise %pcn. I tell ya what.
<ce>                 I got a request to dispose of a giant
<ce>              scorpion. Do that and I'll see if the guild
<ce>            will overlook your reputation. Is that a deal?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       I try to be nice and look
<ce>                       what it gets me. Just get
<ce>                              outta here.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 You got guts %pcf, I'll give ya that.
<ce>            Apparently this scorpion escaped from someone's
<ce>             personal collection. Right now it's cornered in
<ce>                   _house_. Kill the thing today and
<ce>                        I'll speak well of you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              I guess you aren't the weak kneed jellyfish
<ce>               everyone says you are. I'll make sure the
<ce>                     right people hear about this.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                Have you heard about the poor fool that
<ce>               found a giant scorpion in his house? He's
<ce>                       getting drunk right now.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>               Some drunken fool stumbled into his house
<ce>               and got killed by a giant scorpion. Seems
<ce>               he thought the Fighter's Guild had taken
<ce>                          care of the beast.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 The Fighter's Guild is a good bunch.
<ce>                They killed a giant scorpion that found
<ce>                     its way into someone's house.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  Good work with that giant scorpion.
<ce>                At this rate you'll be admitted to the
<ce>                           guild real soon.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 All I asked was that you kill a giant
<ce>                   scorpion. You are worthless %pcf.
