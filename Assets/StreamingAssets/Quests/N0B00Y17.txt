QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  %pct, I am perplexed.  Perhaps you
<ce>                    can help me with some research.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Hmm, yes, if the internal azimuthal
<ce>                vectors really do cross at the anterior
<ce>                  pole, it should be possible ... eh?
<ce>                  Oh, %pct, I didn't see you standing
<ce>                  there.  But how fortuitous!  I need
<ce>                  someone to help me with my research.
<ce>                           Are you available?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Oh, too bad.  Now, where was I?  Mmm,
<ce>              the azimuthal vectors, right.  Let's see...

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Splendid!  You see, I'm working on a
<ce>               particularly thorny problem in theoretical
<ce>                applied magicka, and I need a particular
<ce>                  magic _item_.  Made by _maker_ %g2-
<ce>               self.  By all reports, a masterful little
<ce>              piece of work, but according to my research,
<ce>             impossible.  The internal azimuth vectors are
<ce>              such that I cannot reconcile the externally
<ce>             manifested lateral flow lines ... Well, having
<ce>             the piece to study would help me immeasurably,
<ce>             but I have not had much luck tracking it down.
<ce>             The only reference I've come across mentioned
<ce>              a catalogue once held by the library at ...
<ce>              oh yes, nowadays it's known as ___hintdung_.
<ce>                You might also try a colleague of mine,
<ce>                _scholar_.  %g is an expert on _maker_.
<ce>              Wrote the definitive biography, although in
<ce>              my opinion ... ah, well, no time to get into
<ce>                that old debate.  You'll find _scholar_
<ce>                 in a dank hole called ___scholardung_.
<ce>          I don't see how %g can abide working in such places.
<ce>            Hmm, yes, come back and see me in, say, =time1_
<ce>            days and report your findings.  Yes?  Splendid.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                What do you make of these vector lines?
<ce>                 I've tried using Mencipha's Theorem to
<ce>                 reconcile the coefficients, but I just
<ce>               end up with a mess.  Perhaps if I tried...

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               Who are you?  Oh good heavens, I remember
<ce>                now.  _maker_'s _item_, of course!  And
<ce>                here it is.  Well, as it happens, while
<ce>               you were gone, I had quite a breakthrough
<ce>                in my research.  You see, it wasn't the
<ce>                 azimuth vectors at all, the key to the
<ce>                whole problem is actually ... well, the
<ce>                 point is, I no longer need the _item_.
<ce>                It is a beautiful piece of work, though,
<ce>                isn't it?  Why don't you keep it, since
<ce>                  you went to all the trouble to find
<ce>                  it for me.  Now if you'll excuse me,
<ce>                        I must get back to work.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>  Did you see _questgiver_ wandering the streets last night, mumbling
<ce>              something under %g3 breath?  Crazy old coot!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>       Crazy old _questgiver_ seems more despondent than usual.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>    _questgiver_ has been telling everyone about some %ra who saved
<ce>                %g3 research.  Hey, that was you, right?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>        Eh?  Oh, my good friend %pcf.  You searched all of %reg
<ce>                       for that _item_ I wanted.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                           Eh?  Have we met?

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of ___questgiver_'s
 Mages Guild has sent me to search
 for a certain magic _item_ made by
 a _maker_.  _questgiver_
 suggested I should either look
 in ___hintdung_ for an old
 catalogue, or visit _scholar_,
 an expert on _maker_, who is
 currently doing research in
 ___scholardung_.  I am to
 report my findings within
 =time1_ days to _questgiver_.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 I found _scholar_ in ___scholardung_,
 but %g was not able to help me in my
 search for _maker_'s _item_.

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 _scholar_ suggested that I might
 find _maker_'s _item_ somewhere
 in a place called ___itemdung_.

Message:  1023
%qdt:
 I believe I have found a good
 lead on the _item_.  The old
 catalogue from ___hintdung_
 said that it was once held
 in a place called ___itemdung_.

Message:  1024
%qdt:
 I found part of the old catalogue
 in ___hintdung_, but it gave no
 indication of the location of
 _maker_'s _item_.

Message:  1025
%qdt:
 I spoke with _scholar_ in ___scholardung_.
 %g was unable to help me in my search for
 the _item_, but I agreed to get
 some alchemical ingredients for %g2 from
 _contact_ of __contact_ in
 ___contact_ and return in =time2_ days.

Message:  1030
Item No. 476-A-LCX-08
 
 Type: _item_
 Creator: _maker_ of ___maker_
 
 Description:
 This _item_ is one of _maker_'s
 lesser works, ranking below %g3 famous Wand
 of Verbosity in craftsmanship, and not even
 close to a masterpiece of sheer audacity like
 %g3 Scissors of Styling.  Still, this _item_
 shows _maker_'s distinctive style in the
 many small touches %g puts on all %g3 work:
 the embossed brass fittings with %g3 signature
 stamp, the unusual choice of an enameled finish,
 and especially the mellow amber sparking along
 its exterior flow lines.

 Type: _item_
 Creator: _maker_ of ___maker_
 
 Description:
 This _item_ is one of _maker_'s
 lesser works, ranking below %g3 famous Wand
 of Verbosity in craftsmanship, and not even
 close to a masterpiece of sheer audacity like
 %g3 Scissors of Styling.  In the years since
 _maker_'s death, this piece has dropped out
 of sight, perhaps held by some private collector.
 By the extant descriptions of it, this _item_
 showed _maker_'s distinctive style in the
 many small touches %g puts on all %g3 work:
 the embossed brass fittings with %g3 signature
 stamp, the unusual choice of an enameled finish,
 and especially the mellow amber sparking along
 its exterior flow lines.

Message:  1040
<ce>                   Hullo.  _maker_'s _item_ you say?
<ce>                Yes, I believe I ran across a reference
<ce>               to that very thing just last week.  Where
<ce>              did I put those notes ... Here we are, mmm-
<ce>                 hmm, "mellow amber sparking" -- that's
<ce>                    vintage _maker_ for sure.  Looks
<ce>                 like it was in ___itemdung_, at least
<ce>               it was when this was written.  Good luck!

Message:  1041
<ce>                 Good morning!  Did _contact_ send you
<ce>                  with those supplies that I ordered?
<ce>                   Oh, _questgiver_ said I might know
<ce>                    where to find _maker_'s _item_?
<ce>                   I'm sorry, but that seems to have
<ce>                  disappeared shortly after %g3 death,
<ce>                   and hasn't been heard of since.  A
<ce>                real shame.  But could you do me a favor
<ce>                since you're here?  I need a few things
<ce>                for my work here, and if you could fetch
<ce>                   them for me, I'd be most grateful.

Message:  1042
<ce>                Excellent.  Here, let me jot down what
<ce>                  I need.  Take this list to _contact_
<ce>                     of __contact_ in ___contact_.
<ce>                   %g's the only one I trust to give
<ce>                    me the exact ingredients I need.
<ce>                    I'll expect you back here within
<ce>                    =time2_ days.  Please be prompt.

Message:  1043
<ce>               Too busy, eh?  Well, it was nice talking
<ce>                 to you.  I won't walk you to the door,
<ce>                     if you don't mind.  Good day!

Message:  1044
<ce>                 Another shopping list from _scholar_,
<ce>                eh?  I swear, if I send another shipment
<ce>                  out to %g2 without getting paid ...
<ce>               "Charge to my account", ha!  That's rich.
<ce>                 Listen, I'll give you the _ingredient_
<ce>                %g asked for, but the rest will have to
<ce>               be special ordered, and I'm not doing that
<ce>                  until %g pays me for everything else
<ce>                I've sent to %g2.  I'm sorry, but that's
<ce>                           the best I can do.

QuestTimeLapse:  [1045]
<ce>             Oh, it's you.  Did you bring me the supplies
<ce>                I asked for?  What, _contact_ would only
<ce>                give you this _ingredient_?  That crusty
<ce>              old goat!  I'll give %g2 a piece of my mind
<ce>               when I get out of here.  Well, it's better
<ce>                than nothing I suppose.  Listen, are you
<ce>              still looking for that _item_?  I ran across
<ce>                a reference to an old catalogue from an
<ce>                  exhibition of _maker_'s works.  This
<ce>                catalogue is in ___hintdung_.  In fact,
<ce>              I can teleport you to the very spot, if you
<ce>                like.  You'll have to find your own way
<ce>                   out, of course.  Shall I teleport
<ce>                          you to ___hintdung_?

Message:  1046
<ce>             Hold on to your hat!  By the way, before you
<ce>                go, take this _scholarreward_.  I really
<ce>              do appreciate you fetching the _ingredient_
<ce>                  for me.  Now, away to ___hintdung_.

Message:  1047
<ce>                 As you wish.  By the way, before you
<ce>                go, take this _scholarreward_.  I really
<ce>              do appreciate you fetching the _ingredient_
<ce>                  for me.  I hope you find the _item_.

Message:  1050
<ce>                 This is undoubtedly _maker_'s _item_.

Message:  1060
<ce>                 Hullo, %pcn.  Did you manage to track
<ce>                     down that _item_ of _maker_'s?
<ce>                 Ah well, that's too bad, but I'm sure
<ce>                I will manage to work around the problem
<ce>                 without it.  I know you did your best.
<ce>                  Here's _gold_ gold for your trouble.
