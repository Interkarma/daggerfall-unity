QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              The whining peasants who work my land near
<ce>                    ___mondung_ have long complained
<ce>                 about evil wizardry being practiced in
<ce>                that dungeon. It appears that this time
<ce>                 they may be right. I am in need of an
<ce>                 assassin with enough time to travel to
<ce>                      ___mondung_ and destroy the
<ce>               necromantic sorcerer there. I am prepared
<ce>             to pay _reward_ gold pieces for this service.
<ce>                          Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Really? I would have thought this was your sort
<ce>                  of an assignment. How inconvenient.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                %oth, that's grand. I need to have this
<ce>          wizard extinguished in =1stparton_ days, so you will
<ce>           probably want to get on the road right away. Good
<ce>                     luck, %pcf, and show no mercy.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>           I don't want to see you again until that sorcerer
<ce>                                is dead.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>          The mighty hero returns! The farmers are overjoyed
<ce>             that their land is free of black magic, and I
<ce>           share their joy. Accept the _reward_ gold pieces,
<ce>                        %pcf, with my gratitude.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
You can almost feel the malevolent magicka building.
<--->
Some sorcerer has vowed to reduce _questgiver_'s land to rubble.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That sorcerer in ___mondung_ has apparently moved on.
<--->
Apparently some adventurer spooked the sorcerer out of ___mondung_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The Mad Wizard of ___mondung_ was apparently slain by a brave %ra.
<--->
Had that sorcerer survived, _questgiver_ would have been in deep trouble.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, the slayer of the mad wizard is back. How are you, my friend?
<--->
A pleasure to see you again, o killer of mad wizards.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  You weren't expecting a reward for
<ce>                  your failure to slay that wizard, I
<ce>                    hope. You're lucky I don't have
<ce>                              you flogged.
                                     <--->
<ce>                         So, the %ra returns.
<ce>                   So, I imagine, will the wizard you
<ce>                     failed to slay. Run along now.

Message:  1011
<ce>              _questgiver_ is a noble with a real hatred
<ce>                   for a sorcerer called _fakename_.
                                     <--->
<ce>             _questgiver_ is a noble who has been plagued
<ce>                    by a sorcerer called _fakename_.

Message:  1012
_fakename_ the wizard is dead.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
_questgiver_
 of __questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 has sent me to ___mondung_,
 where I am to slay a mad wizard.
 If I can have the deed accomplished
 and be back to %g2 in =1stparton_ days,
 I will earn my gold.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   You must be the latest poor fool
<ce>                    _questgiver_ has hired to try to
<ce>                  kill me.  Your bones will soon join
<ce>                  those of your compatriots, scattered
<ce>                           about my dungeon!
