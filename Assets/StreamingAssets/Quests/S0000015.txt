RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There were some strange men here asking about a %ra named %pcn.
<--->
Didn't like the look of those thugs. Thank %god they moved on.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The stars foretell dreams that will never come true.
<--->
There are dangerous portents the oracles of %reg have foreseen.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear things are getting kind of rocky in Wayrest.
<--->
I heard that they found the body of King Lysandus!

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
That looks like Lord Woodborne's private journal.

 from childhood. I know that Gothryd would not refuse
 his aid, but I must bide my time to ask. After all,
 Elysana is still heiress of Wayrest and I am her
 betrothed. So it should be that when Eadwyre dies
 (which he is bound to do, sooner rather than later)
 I will be king.
    If it weren't for that bitch queen and her brats,
 I would and could be patient. Never trust a dark elf
 the old saying goes, for you cannot read truth in
 their eyes. If Barenziah has her way, Helseth will
 be heir and Elysana will be married off to some far-
 off kingdom. Morgiah is already promised to the
 heir of Firsthold, but they keep her around to spread
 the poison against Elysana, and especially, me.
    Barenziah doesn't trust me, this I can tell.
 I will deal with her just as I did with Lysandus.
 The fool should have agreed to support me. Gortwog
 and his orcs almost saved him. I'll deal with those
 sub-humans once I sit upon the throne of Wayrest.
    First it is important to solidify my power base.
 I can (almost certainly) rely on Gothryd to support
 my bid for the throne, if Helseth is made heir. I
 have a spy network equalling Eadwyre, Gothryd,
 Akorith-i, or the Emperor. Perhaps the Necromancers
 and the Underking's networks are more extensive, but
 I doubt it. The problem is raw physical power. I do
 not have a standing army. I need the gold to raise

%qdt:
 I found a most damning couple of pages
 in Woodborne Hall. I'm sure Lord Woodborne
 would be quite livid if they were to fall
 into the wrong hands.

Message:  1019
%qdt:
 Lysandus' ghost appeared to me and told me
 that only the death or humiliation of his
 murderer, Lord Woodborne, would lay his soul
 to rest. Lord Woodborne is a noble of Wayrest
 and betrothed to Princess Elysana. He has a
 castle in the wilderness of Wayrest.

Message:  1021
I hear Lord Woodborne was beheaded for treason.
<--->
They caught Lord Woodborne and tried him for treason.

Message:  1022
I heard a flock of Daedra descended upon Lord Woodborne and carried him off.
<--->
Things from beyond the grave rose and assaulted Woodborne Hall!
--added "and" to fix poor grammar
<--->
I hear Lord Woodborne cheated the Mages Guild. They sent demons to kill him.
--added "to" to fix poor grammar

Message:  1024
I heard that Lord Woodborne will be marrying Princess Elysana.
<--->
Lord Woodborne is in high favor these days at Castle Wayrest.

Message:  1030
<ce>             This means little to me. It is trash fit only
<ce>            for being burnt. Gothryd and Woodborne plotting
<ce>                  to kill Lysandus. Really! Go away.

Message:  1031
<ce>             This is atrocious! After all the affection we
<ce>          showered on that fool Woodborne! We nearly married
<ce>           that villainous swine to Elysana -- nearly handed
<ce>          the throne of Wayrest to a cad of the first order!
<ce>           Good %pcf, it was the right thing to do to bring
<ce>             this to our attention. Rest assured that Lord
<ce>            Woodborne will be arrested and executed for his
<ce>           treason, his name barred from the books of honor,
<ce>              his acquaintances interrogated, his fortune
<ce>            confiscated. As a gift, please allow me to give
<ce>             you _reward_ gold pieces as your share of his
<ce>                        property confiscations.

Message:  1032
<ce>                Lord Woodborne is the slayer of my dear
<ce>               Lysandus. There shall be justice, and it
<ce>              shall come from my hand! You would do best
<ce>              to stay clear of Woodborne Hall and Wayrest
<ce>                          for some time %pcn.

Message:  1033
<ce>               This information is quite valuable %pcf.
<ce>              Let me gift you with _gold_ gold for giving
<ce>               it to me. This will be quite handy in the
<ce>                           coming conflict.

Message:  1034
<ce>               You were completely correct to bring this
<ce>               to me. Otherwise it might have gotten out
<ce>               where it could do Lord Woodborne damage.
<ce>                        Guards! Kill this %ra!

Message:  1040
<ce>                      You! You're that %ra %pcn.
<ce>              You have been a thorn in my side for a long
<ce>                 time now. A wiser %ra would have let
<ce>              sleeping kings lie. Especially when I have
<ce>             gone to such great lengths to kill them. Yes
<ce>               %pcf, I killed King Lysandus. And now it
<ce>               will be a pleasure to slay you. En garde!

QuestTimeLapse:  [1045]
<ce>                  "I am...done in. It is up...to...to
<ce>                  Gothryd now. May you...rot in hell
<ce>                   %pcn. I most...certainly shall."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                        Lord Woodborne is dead.
