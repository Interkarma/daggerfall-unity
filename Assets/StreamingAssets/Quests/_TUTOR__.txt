<ce>                  you letters of credit. They hardly

<ce>                  You can't sleep in the streets. The

<ce>                    Things are really heating up in
<ce>                  the city of Daggerfall. You should

<ce>                    I've heard that the royalty of

<ce>                    a great opportunity for anyone

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>             The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall has a tutorial
<ce>              that can be active during the game. It runs
<ce>             throughout this first dungeon and for a short
<ce>                time afterward. Do you want to use this
<ce>                               tutorial?

<ce>                           Tutorial Lesson 1
<ce>                                    
<ce>           The very first thing you want to do is experiment
<ce>            with moving your character around. Don't worry
<ce>          about monsters, there are none in this first room.
<ce>                                    
<ce>           When this text clears, move the mouse around
<ce>            to change where you are looking.
<ce>
<ce>              Use the W, A, S and D keys to go around.
<ce>          Hint: Those are the default keys. You can change them later
<ce>          using the ESC key and then the CONTROLS button.
<ce>                                    
<ce>          I'll be back in about one minute to tell you about
<ce>                arming yourself and fighting monsters.

<ce>                           Tutorial Lesson 2
<ce>                                    
<ce>           Before you brave the depths of Privateer's Hold,
<ce>          you will want to arm yourself. Press the F6 key
<ce>          to bring up your inventory window.
<ce>                                    
<ce>          Clicking on the weapon puts it into your hand. Now
<ce>          you are able to draw your weapon. Click on the EXIT
<ce>                    button to go back to the game.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         Hint: You can have two weapons equipped. Press the H
<ce>              key to switch back and forth between them.
<ce>

<ce>                                    
<ce>        To draw your weapon, just press the Z key. There is
<ce>        a short delay after equipping a weapon, so don't panic
<ce>        if it doesn't draw instantly.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         Take a few practice swings by holding down the right
<ce>         mouse button and moving the mouse around. This is how
<ce>                        you fight the monsters.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         Hint: Moving your mouse in different directions makes
<ce>        the sword swing differently. Each type of swing affects
<ce>      your chances to hit the monster and how much damage you do.
<ce>                                    
<ce>        I'll give you a minute to practice swinging the sword.
<ce>                                    
<ce>           Click YES to continue, NO to cancel the tutorial.

<ce>                           Tutorial Lesson 4
<ce>                                    
<ce>          Down the hall and through the door is a giant rat.
<ce>                           Let's go kill it!
<ce>
<ce>           When you get to the door, just get it in the
<ce>           center of the screen and press the mouse button
<ce>          to open it. This is how you activate things, such as
<ce>          doors, levers, wheels, treasure piles, even people.
<ce>          You can sometimes get treasure off of dead bodies
<ce>            by clicking on them, just like treasure piles.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         Hint: This door is a secret door. After you kill the
<ce>         rat, go back to it and click it. The door will shut.
<ce>              Not all secret doors are this easy to see.
<ce>                                    
<ce>       I'll be back in a couple of minutes for the next lesson.

<ce>                           Tutorial Lesson 5
<ce>                                    
<ce>         There is a pile of treasure on the black altar in the
<ce>          room with the rat. Get close to it and click on it.
<ce>         This automatically puts you into your inventory. All
<ce>          the stuff in the treasure pile is in the right hand
<ce>                       column of your inventory.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         You have two modes to choose from, EQUIP and REMOVE.
<ce>          Click one of them. Now when you click on an item in
<ce>         the right column, it goes into your inventory (REMOVE
<ce>          mode) or directly onto your character (EQUIP mode).
<ce>                                    
<ce>            Hint: You can get information on your items by
<ce>            using the INFO mode and then clicking the item.
<ce>                                    
<ce>          I'll be back in one minute for a save game lesson.
<ce>           Click YES to continue, NO to cancel the tutorial.

<ce>                                    
<ce>         This would be a good time to save the game (assuming
<ce>         you are not in the middle of a fight). Press the ESC
<ce>          key and click on SAVE GAME.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         If you get killed in this dungeon, you can go back to
<ce>       that saved game without having to create a new character.
<ce>                                    
<ce>        Hint: You can also use F9 to quicksave and
<ce>            F12 to quickload.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         I'll leave you for several minutes now. Go ahead and
<ce>           explore the dungeon. Click YES to continue, NO to
<ce>                         cancel the tutorial.

<ce>                                    
<ce>          If you have a spell casting character, try using a
<ce>                    spell against the next monster.
<ce>                                    
<ce>          Press the BACKSPACE key to pull up the spells menu.
<ce>        select SHOCK by double clicking on it. This spell will
<ce>        only work if you are close enough to touch the monster
<ce>            To cast the spell, press the left mouse button;
<ce>        spells are always fired at the center of the screen.
<ce>                                    
<ce>           I'll wait until you have escaped from the dungeon
<ce>                    for your next tutorial lesson.

<ce>                                    
<ce>         Congratulations! You have made it out of the starter
<ce>                      dungeon, Privateer's Hold.
<ce>         I bet you are wondering what to do now? What you need
<ce>           is a town. Towns have the services you will need
<ce>             throughout the game. Lets fast travel to one.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                            (continued...)

Message:  1041
<ce>         Fast travel is done by pressing the V key. The region
<ce>          that you are in (Daggerfall) is highlighted in red.
<ce>         Click on that region and you get a blow up map. There
<ce>        are a lot of places on this map! Lets find the city of
<ce>            Daggerfall. Click FIND and type in DAGGERFALL.
<ce>           The most convenient way to travel is by clicking
<ce>          CAUTIOUSLY and INNS, both of which are the default
<ce>          settings. Otherwise you risk arriving at night and
<ce>              having to climb the walls to get into town.
<ce>                                    
<ce>           For this tutorial to continue, you should go to a
<ce>           large city, such as the city of Daggerfall. We'll
<ce>           pick up the lessons again in =2dagger_ days. This
<ce>             should give you plenty of time to get there.

<ce>                                    
<ce>         Ah, the sights and sounds of the city! Did you arrive
<ce>        at night or try to rest? If so, the guards will not let
<ce>         anyone sleep in the streets or even too close to the
<ce>           walls. You can only rest in Taverns, if you have
<ce>                        purchased a room there.
<ce>                                    
<ce>        The first thing you want to do is to press the F4 key to
<ce>         set your mode to DIALOGUE (you can change the mode of
<ce>       interaction anytime using F1 to F4). Now get close to one
<ce>        of the townsfolk. They won't stop to talk to you unless
<ce>         you are not moving. Click on the person and you will
<ce>                  be placed into the Dialogue screen.
<ce>

<ce>        You want to find a general store or weaponsmith. It is
<ce>         one of the places you can sell your excess gear. The
<ce>          person will probably give you directions. Travel in
<ce>       that direction for a while and then ask another passerby.
<ce>     Continue this until somebody marks the location on your map.
<ce>                                    
<ce>        Press M to view the map of the city. You should be able
<ce>        to tell where the building is from that. All shops have
<ce>       signs out front. Learn the signs and you will be able to
<ce>        get around much easier. You will need a tavern to rest.
<ce>                     look for the mug of ale sign.
<ce>                                    
<ce>       Hint: Pressing F3 switchs you to INFO mode. You can click
<ce>      on buildings to learn what they are. Some shops don't open
<ce>      until late in the day. You can loiter (a REST option) until
<ce>              the shopkeeper decides to unlock the door.
<ce>                                    
<ce>       Don't leave town! I'll check in with you again tomorrow.

<ce>                          Tutorial Lesson 10
<ce>                                    
<ce>      Today's lesson is about guilds. A guild is an organization
<ce>       that offers benefits for its members. As you rise in rank
<ce>        in a guild, you get more benefits. To rise in rank, you
<ce>        must improve skills that guild cares about, and perform
<ce>       quests on a regular basis to improve your reputation with
<ce>             them. You can belong to more than one guild.
<ce>                                    
<ce>        All spellcasters should join the Mages Guild. Everyone
<ce>        should pick a temple to join. However, pick carefully.
<ce>         You can only be a member of one temple. Fighter type
<ce>        characters should join either the fighter's guild or a
<ce>                            knightly order.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         Hint: Thieves and murderers, just do your thing. The
<ce>              underworld will contact you after a while.
<ce>                                    
<ce>              I'll be back tomorrow with the next lesson.

<ce>                                    
<ce>        Today we want a quest. A quest is an adventure given by
<ce>      someone in town. Its amazing how many people in Daggerfall
<ce>             need the services of a brave hero or heroine.
<ce>                                    
<ce>      Go to someone in a tavern or on the street. Ask them about
<ce>       work. Odds are that they will direct you to someone else
<ce>      in town. That person will offer you a quest. You don't have
<ce>     to take every quest that is offered. Successfully completing
<ce>       a quest means that person, and his friends, will like you
<ce>       a little better. It can also be profitable. Last, but not
<ce>             least, it is the best way to locate dungeons!

Message:  1056
<ce>        This is the last of the tutorial lessons. There is much
<ce>       more to learn about Tamriel and about the game. However,
<ce>        you now have the basics to be able to explore and learn
<ce>                       these things on your own.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                       Good luck, and have fun!
