QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               Imagine the purity of my delight when my
<ce>               sniveling, cheating lover of the past two
<ce>               years was abducted and presumably killed.
<ce>               Then imagine my despair when I discovered
<ce>                 that the =victim_ was still among the
<ce>              living. Next, imagine my amusement when %g3
<ce>             kidnappers demanded a ransom. Finally, please
<ce>             imagine my annoyance when %g3 cousin actually
<ce>              agreed to pay the ransom. This cannot be. I
<ce>                 need someone to make certain that the
<ce>                   ransoming fails. Will you help me?


RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        %oth, what an attitude.
<ce>                     Your selfish morality will get
<ce>                        you in trouble some day.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                              %oth, %oth,
<ce>                               and %oth.
<ce>             The way I see it, there are three ways to stop
<ce>             this ransoming. One is to make sure that dear
<ce>                         _victim_ accidentally
<ce>           dies before the ransom date in =queston1_ days. Of
<ce>             course, I don't know where %g is, so that's a
<ce>            difficult one. The next option is to see to %g3
<ce>             cousin's accidental death within the same time
<ce>                      frame. Now, =cousin_, that's
<ce>                   the cousin, lives in ___mondung2_,
<ce>             which is a well-fended fortress. So there's a
<ce>            difficulty there. Finally, you could remove the
<ce>                      _gem_ from ___mondung2_ that
<ce>                     =cousin_ plans to use for the
<ce>              ransom. Whatever way you do it, be back here
<ce>            with the news in =queston1_ days or sooner, and
<ce>                     you'll be _gold_ gold richer.
<ce>                          Good luck, old %ra.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        So, poor _victim_ won't
<ce>                 be coming home? Well done, my friend.
<ce>               Here's the _gold_ gold pieces I promised.
<ce>                        Best money I ever spent.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Poor _qgiver_. Grief is terrible. You know, %g looks ten years younger.
<--->
=cousin_ suspects that _qgiver_ doesn't really want _victim_ back.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_qgiver_ is furious with a %ra named %pcn for some reason.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
It looks like _victim_ really never will come back to ___qgiver_.
<--->
_qgiver_ is now deeply in mourning for _victim_. It's very sad.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You saved me from that corpulent toad _victim_, %pcf. Don't think I forgot.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                I asked you to do one thing, and I gave
<ce>                you three ways to do it. And you failed.
<ce>                 Why should I talk to you, you pickled
<ce>                          vat of dung patties?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 __qgiver_, ___qgiver_ has
 sent me to prevent %g3 unloved lover's
 ransom. I can either find and slay this
 _victim_, but I have
 no clue of where %g is. Or I can go to
 ___mondung2_, %g3
 cousin, =cousin_'s
 stronghold and either slay %g2 or steal
 the _gem_ %g was going to use for
 ransom. In any case, I need to have
 something done and be back with old
 _qgiver_ in =queston1_ days
 when the ransom is due to be paid.

<ce>                        _victim_'s heart gives
<ce>                    out at the shock of seeing a %ra
<ce>                               mercenary.

<ce>                         "Come violent death,"
<ce>                        _victim_ says, quaffing
<ce>                    a draught of poison. "I will be
<ce>                       reunited with my true love
<ce>                            _qgiver_ in the
<ce>                              hereafter."

%pcf,
 
     _victim_ is being held in
 ___mondung_. Do your worst.
 
     We don't mind. The kidnappers are bloody
 freelancers.

<ce>                     A nondescript fellow slips a
<ce>                    note into your hand, winks, and
<ce>                                departs.

Message:  1017
%qdt:
 I received a
 letter from the Thieves Guild. It
 seems that the kidnappers are not
 members of the Guild, so they have no
 compunction in giving me their
 location: ___mondung_.
 If I want to put an end to the unloved
 _victim_'s life, that's
 the place to do it.

<ce>                       Why, you bloody, bollocky
<ce>                            %ra, that hurt!

<ce>                        You probably think that
<ce>                           hurts, don't cha?

Message:  1019
<ce>                        _victim_'s cousin, %g3
<ce>                 only hope, is launched into eternity.

<ce>                           =cousin_ will not
<ce>                        be ransoming anyone now.

Message:  1020
