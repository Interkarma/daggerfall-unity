QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>           Oh, yes my dear, I think I can help you with your
<ce>           ambition. If I give you something quite valuable,
<ce>                  will you do something for me first?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Oh, that's a shame. As a friendly warning, bad
<ce>            things happen to greedy %ra adventurers willing
<ce>                   to take, but not willing to give.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>          You will? Oh, that's very sweet. Much sweeter than
<ce>              a certain _monster_ I know named =monster_,
<ce>          who made a certain arrangement with me, but decided
<ce>           later to renege. If you would be so kind as to pay
<ce>              =monster_ a visit in ___mondung_ and
<ce>            let %g2 know that such ungallant behavior is fatal. Then go to
<ce>         my dear friend, _qgfriend_, who will wait for =1stparton_ days
<ce>                for you at __qgfriend_ in ___qgfriend_,
<ce>         and give you my _artifact_ when you arrive. It's just
<ce>        the thing you need. Now, you'd best be off. Be careful.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>          You aren't planning on repaying Meridia's kindness
<ce>               by telling me that you've slain =monster_
<ce>               when both of us know you haven't, are you?
<ce>                         I certainly hope not.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                %pcn? I'm _qgfriend_. I believe you're
<ce>              looking for me. I have here the _artifact_,
<ce>           as Meridia promised. Meridia is impressed with you
<ce>         for fulfilling your end of the contract, I might add.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The sorcerer in ___mondung_ is a notorious collector of strange artifacts.
<--->
I hear that =monster_ contracts with spirits for additions to %g3 collections.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That packrat sorcerer finally left ___mondung_. I guess to acquire more stuff.
<--->
That =qgfriend_ _qgfriend_ left __qgfriend_ muttering about a dishonest %ra.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
They say that some creature from =monster_'s collection rose up and killed %g2.
<--->
=monster_ was apparently killed by someone interested in %g3 vast collection.

Message:  1011
_qgfriend_ is the name of that =qgfriend_ at __qgfriend_, just %di of here.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is a quiet =qgfriend_ I met at __qgfriend_. That's to the %di.

Message:  1012
_qgfriend_ is one of Meridia's collectors in %reg. Charming, as %g has to be.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is a servitor of the Daedra Lady of Greed, Meridia.

Message:  1013
Meridia is a Daedra Regent and a collector of human specimens.
<--->
Meridia is a kind of acting Daedra Prince, and ruthless in her acquisitiveness.

Message:  1014
<ce>   The ring is an ancient item of power. Reputedly, it can make its
<ce>          wearer as invisible, silent, and swift as the wind.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I have =1stparton_ days to find and slay a
 _monster_ named =monster_, be in
 ___qgfriend_ to meet a =qgfriend_
 named _qgfriend_, and receive Meridia's
 promised artifact, the _artifact_.
 I know =monster_'s location is
 ___mondung_, and _qgfriend_ is
 in ___qgfriend_.


Message:  1030
<ce>                   =monster_ lies dead at your feet.
<ce>                   Lady Meridia is now in your debt.

Message:  1040
<ce>               So, Meridia sends her lackeys against me.
<ce>                 But I am not without allies of my own.
<ce>                Come to me, children of Oblivion!  Serve
<ce>               your master =monster_ in %g3 hour of need!
