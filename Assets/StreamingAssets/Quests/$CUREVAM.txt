<ce>               As =bloodfather_ dies, you feel the curse
<ce>                   of vampirism lift from your soul.
<ce>                      You are no longer a vampire.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce> _hunter_ is leading a new crusade against vampires through %reg soon.
<ce> Maybe then we'll be able to walk the streets at night again without fear.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>_hunter_ and %g3 men killed a lot of vampires in %reg, but I doubt they
<ce>                             got them all.
                                     <--->
<ce> _hunter_ should have left well enough alone.  %g3 crusades just send
<ce> the vampires into hiding, and when %g leaves, they come back stronger than  ever.

_hunter_ searches out and destroys vampires all across Tamriel.
<--->
_hunter_ has devoted %g3 life to hunting vampires.

Message:  1012
<ce>They say that _hunter_'s own father was killed by vampires.  That's what
<ce>               drove %g2 to %g3 fanatical hatred of them.
                                     <--->
<ce> _hunter_ killed %g3 own father after he became a vampire.  Now that's
<ce>                       what I call a true zealot!

 Dear %pcn of %vam,
 
    Let me introduce myself.  I am _hunter_.
 You may have heard of me -- the renowned vampire
 hunter?  Do not be hasty in your judgment of me,
 however.  I am not your enemy, at least not yet.
 While I abhor vampirism with a passion, and have
 devoted my life to stamping out this dark plague
 from Tamriel, I understand that many are innocent
 victims like yourself.  The will to live is not
 of itself evil, and I always try to offer my quarry
 one chance to prove that their bloody work is based
 on necessity, not love for killing.
    I am sure that your "kinfolk" have not told
 you this, but vampirism can be cured.  To do so,
 you must kill your "bloodfather", the ancient evil
 that created the line of vampires leading to you.
 In doing so, you will not only free yourself, but
 rid %reg of a cancer at its heart.
 
<ce>                              (continued)
 
    I myself do not know where to find your
 "bloodfather," but my sources have revealed the name
 of one high in %vam who should have this information,
 _vamp1_ of ___vamp1_.  I will wait
 =huntstart_ days before moving against the vampires of %reg,
 to give you a chance to save yourself.
    Consider my offer well, %pcn.  You have
 =huntstart_ days, then you and the rest of %vam
 will be hunted down like vermin.
 
<ce>                                _hunter_

Message:  1021
<ce>                      Do you want to show _vamp1_
<ce>                       the letter from _hunter_?

Message:  1022
<ce>                You have done well to bring this to me,
<ce>                   %pcn.  _hunter_ has been the bane
<ce>             of %vam for years.  With this advance warning,
<ce>             we can save the lives of many of our kinfolk.
<ce>              Do not underestimate the danger you are in,
<ce>               %pcf.  _hunter_ is ruthless and competent,
<ce>              and %g3 spies are everywhere.  %g would make
<ce>              an excellent addition to %vam -- perhaps %g
<ce>              will yet.  Be that as it may, %g knows your
<ce>              name, and do not doubt that %g will attempt
<ce>                      to make good on %g3 threat.
<ce>                      May the night keep you safe.

Message:  1023
<ce>                  %pcn, isn't it?  I have heard good
<ce>                things about you from the rest of %vam.
<ce>               So, you want to find your bloodfather.  An
<ce>           understandable urge, although this is a privilege
<ce>               not usually granted to one of your youth.
<ce>              However, you have made such progress in %vam
<ce>            already, I believe I can make an exception.  Let
<ce>          me see, he must be either =elder_ or =bloodfather_.
<ce>                 You can find them at ___wrongdung_ and
<ce>                 ___fatherdung_, respectively.  I would
<ce>                 advise against intruding on an elder's
<ce>             seclusion lightly, however.  It would be best
<ce>                 if you looked up _vamp2_ of ___vamp2_.
<ce>              %g is the Keeper of the Bloodline, and will
<ce>              be able to tell you with certainty which of
<ce>              %vam elders is your bloodfather.  Take this
<ce>              bracelet to %g2 so %g will know I sent you.

Message:  1024
<ce>               Hmph.  You are very young to be entrusted
<ce>               with such information.  However, since you
<ce>              carry _vamp1_'s token, I will reveal to you
<ce>            where your bloodfather, =bloodfather_, resides.
<ce>            You will find him in his lair in ___fatherdung_.
<ce>             Be aware that at this time of year, the elders
<ce>                 do not like to be disturbed by anyone.
<ce>          Intrude upon =bloodfather_'s solitude at your peril.

Message:  1025
<ce>                Bloodtraitor!  We have learned of your
<ce>             treachery.  You will never find =bloodfather_,
<ce>                 although your days as one of %vam are
<ce>                  about to end, do not worry. _hunter_
<ce>                    will not need to hunt you down.

Message:  1030
<ce>               Stripling, do not disturb my meditations!
<ce>                    Begone, or my hunger will force
<ce>                            me to slay you!

Message:  1031
<ce>                        You have slain =elder_,
<ce>                             Elder of %vam.

Message:  1032
<ce>                     %pcn, your blood calls to me.
<ce>                   Why do you strike your own father?
<ce>                      %vam punishes patricide with
<ce>                  death.  Do not force me to carry out
<ce>                 this sentence myself.  Flee, my child!

Message:  1040
<ce>                   _hunter_ said I'd find you here.
<ce>                           Die, nightstalker!

QuestTimeLapse:  [1045]
<ce>                   An unfamiliar object in your pack
<ce>                   catches your eye.  It is a letter,
<ce>                 addressed to you in an elegant flowing
<ce>                    script.  How did that get there?

Message:  1050
%qdt:
 The vampire hunter _hunter_
 has sent me a letter vowing to
 hunt me down unless I cure myself
 of vampirism by killing my bloodfather.
 _hunter_ does not know who or where
 my bloodfather is, but %g suggested
 that _vamp1_ of
 ___vamp1_ might know.
 I have =huntstart_ days before the vampire
 hunt begins.

-moved vamp1 line down, was running outside journal boundaries

Message:  1051
%qdt:
 _vamp1_ believes that my bloodfather
 lives either in ___wrongdung_ or
 ___fatherdung_, but advised that
 I take %g3 bracelet to _vamp2_ of
 __vamp2_, ___vamp2_, who can
 tell me for sure where to find him.

Message:  1052
%qdt:
 _vamp2_ told me that my bloodfather's
 name is =bloodfather_, and that he
 lives in ___fatherdung_.
