QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    How are you, %pcf?  If you need
<ce>                   work, I've got somethin' for you.
<ce>                 Standard protection job.  Interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Sure, you're lookin' for more high class
<ce>                        work these days, right?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   All right.  The client's name is
<ce>                    _victim_, over at _victimhouse_
<ce>                just up the street from here.  %g wants
<ce>                   you over there right away.  Seemed
<ce>                   very agitated, you know the type.
<ce>                     %g'll give you all the details
<ce>                          when you get there.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                That's all I know.  Better get movin'.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 I don't know how I can thank you for
<ce>                  saving my life, as well as avenging
<ce>                 my father's death.  Please accept this
<ce>                _reward_.  It belonged to my father, and
<ce>                      I would like you to have it.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>     Too bad about _victim_, eh?  Apparently he was in more danger
<ce>                           than he realized.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>     I know it wasn't your fault, but that business with _victim_
<ce>        still makes me feel bad.  I shoulda taken the poor chap
<ce>                        more seriously, I guess.

Message:  1015
<ce>   _darkb_ lives in ___darkb_, I think.  %g's always hanging around
<ce>    with sinister types, though, so don't go looking for %g2 unless
<ce>                      you're looking for trouble.
                                     <--->
<ce>              _darkb_ hangs around in ___darkb_, mainly.

Message:  1016
<ce>     _darkb_ is one of the leaders of the local Dark Brotherhood.
<ce>             %g3 headquarters is in __darkb_ in ___darkb_.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild of ___questgiver_
 has sent me to _victimhouse_
 to meet with a client, _victim_,
 who is in need of some protection.
 _victim_ will give me the full
 details himself.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 I was too late.  I surprised the
 assassins at _victimhouse_, but
 _victim_ was already dead.

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 I received a note from _daughter_,
 who says she is _victim_'s daughter.
 She asked me to come visit her at
 _daughterhouse_ in __daughterhouse_
 if I get the chance.

Message:  1023
%qdt:
 I went to meet _daughter_, but
 it turned out to be an ambush.
 I fought my way free, and am now
 on my way to _safehouse_ in
 __safehouse_ with _daughter_.

Message:  1030
This is what happens
 to people who don't
 listen to my warnings.
 
<ce>                                _darkb_

Message:  1031
Dear %pcn:
 
   My name is _daughter_, daughter
 of _victim_.  When I heard of your
 heroic action in avenging my father's
 death, I wanted to thank you myself.
 I would be grateful if you could come
 see me, if you have time.
 
<ce>                               _daughter_
<ce>                            _daughterhouse_,
<ce>                            __daughterhouse_

Message:  1035
<ce>               Back off, mate, or we'll do you the same
<ce>                    way we did _victim_ over there.

Message:  1036
<ce>                     You should spend as much time
<ce>                     sharpening your wits as you do
<ce>                         sharpening your blade,
<ce>                       %pcn.  Nothing is simpler
<ce>                       than laying an ambush for
<ce>                       you Fighters Guild thugs.

Message:  1040
<ce>       Did you hear about _victim_?  Cut down in broad daylight
<ce>                            in his own home.
                                     <--->
<ce>         Everyone knows the Dark Brotherhood killed _victim_,
<ce>             but no one is willing to do anything about it.

Message:  1041
<ce>           The Dark Brotherhood is furious over some %ra who
<ce>                    killed one of their higher-ups.
                                     <--->
<ce>         The Dark Brotherhood has vowed to track down whoever
<ce>              broke into their headquarters in ___darkb_.
<ce>                 I'm sure glad it's not me their after.

Message:  1050
<ce>               Yes...?  Wait, you're that Fighters Guild
<ce>                  musclehead poor old _victim_ thought
<ce>                     could protect him, aren't you?
<ce>                       Who let this %ra in here?!

Message:  1051
<ce>                            %pcn, look out!
<ce>                              It's a trap!

Message:  1052
<ce>                    Thank you from rescuing me from
<ce>                     those assassins.  If you could
<ce>                        get me to _safehouse_ in
<ce>                      __safehouse_, I can make my
<ce>                 escape from %reg on my own from there.

Message:  1070
<ce>                    A dusty courier flags you down.
<ce>                      "%pcn?  Thank %god, at last.
<ce>                        This letter is for you."

Message:  1071
<ce>                       Thank you for your help,
<ce>                    but I'll go on my own from here.
