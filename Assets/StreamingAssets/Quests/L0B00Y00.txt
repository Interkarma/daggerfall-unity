QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                There is a traitor in the Brotherhood.
<ce>               You will perform the necessary accounting
<ce>                   on this liability, will you not?
                                     <--->
<ce>                 From time to time, the Brotherhood is
<ce>                 forced to do an accounting in our own
<ce>                books. A traitor has been found within
<ce>                our order who must be settled. You have
<ce>                    been selected to do the honors.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 An ignoble reply. I expected better.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Very good. The traitor has taken
<ce>                         refuge in ___mondun_
<ce>                 to the %di. If you have not returned
<ce>                 in =queston_ days, your honor will be
<ce>               forfeit and another will take your place.
<ce>                     Do not fail us in this, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  The traitor is not dead. Do not try
<ce>                       to convince me otherwise.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Well done. You have reason to be proud.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That assassin ran off to ___mondun_ like the hounds of hell were behind him.
<--->
_qgiver_ can't just let that traitor go after what %g did to the Brotherhood.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That traitor is apparently tougher than _qgiver_ thought. What an escape.
<--->
<ce>              The nightblade has moved north I hear, but
 the memory still plagues the Brotherhood.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The traitor's story just proves it. You don't play around with the Brotherhood.
<--->
I never thought the Brotherhood would be merciful to a dolt like that traitor assassin.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
What do you need, o slayer of the traitor?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  I am ill at ease speaking with you.
<ce>                  After all, I trusted you to account
<ce>                        that traitor, didn't I?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 The Dark Brotherhood in ___qgiver_ has
 sent me to find and slay a traitor to the guild.
 The rogue assassin is hiding out in ___mondun_.
 I have =queston_ days to accomplish this.

Message:  1021
<ce>                        "I am not...the traitor
<ce>                     you...think I am. The...real
<ce>            traitor is..." The contract has been fulfilled.
