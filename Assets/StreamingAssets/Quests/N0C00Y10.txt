QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                     My name is _giver_. You want
<ce>               work but you aren't a member of the Mages
<ce>              guild? I'm sure you can understand that we
<ce>              only provide quality work for our members.
<ce>                However, I do have a little errand that
<ce>                 needs to be done. One of our books is
<ce>              missing. If you were to find and return it,
<ce>               I would consider it a personal favor, one
<ce>                that would reflect well on you with the
<ce>                             entire guild.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Obviously you are not interested in
<ce>               being on good terms with the Mages Guild.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               We have no clues at the moment. The name
<ce>                    of the book is _book_. You will
<ce>                have to snoop around and ask people if
<ce>               they have heard anything. Bring the book
<ce>                      back to me if you find it.

QuestFail:  [1003]
%qdt:
 I have agreed to find the book _book_
 for the Mages Guild of ___giver_.
 If I find it, I need to get it back to
 _giver_ and %g will put in a
 good word for me with the guild.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                              Ah, _book_.
<ce>                           Well done, %pcf.
<ce>                      The Guild is certainly more
<ce>                       favorably inclined toward
<ce>                                 you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The Mages Guild has a very rare edition of _book_. Or at least, they had one.
<--->
_book_ is a rare book, but the edition the Mages Guild had was even more rare.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
It's a great loss to the Mages Guild -- that special edition of _book_.
<--->
The Mages Guild library isn't what it used to be, now that _book_ is gone.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The Mages Guild's library is enriched now that _book_ is back on the shelves.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Did you happen to read _book_ when you had it? It's quite fascinating.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      I gave you a chance, %pcf.
<ce>                  Remember? If you had found _book_,
<ce>                    I'd be happy to talk to you. As
<ce>                      it is now, well, you can go
<ce>                               away now.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                          You may want to try
<ce>                     _informant_ in _informant1_.
<ce>                           %g seems to know
<ce>                        everything that goes on
<ce>                         around __informant1_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                         You should ask at the
<ce>                       local inns. They are full
<ce>                              of gossip.
                                     <--->
<ce>                            You should try
<ce>               _informant1_. There's always talk there.
                                     <--->
<ce>                      It was stolen from _giver_.
                                     <--->
<ce>               _giver_ has been asking around about it.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  I really enjoyed it when I read it.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 You should probably visit a library.

Message:  1011
<ce>        This must be the book, which was stolen from __giver_.

<ce>                for some time. And %g is also the type
<ce>                   who takes things without asking,
