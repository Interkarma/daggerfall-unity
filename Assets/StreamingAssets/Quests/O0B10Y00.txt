<ce>                       Listen, %pcf, we got one
<ce>                    of our family who's in trouble.
<ce>                     You got a couple days to help
<ce>                        out one of the family?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Alright then. Guess you're
<ce>                      countin' on not bein' in a
<ce>                        fix yourself some day.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       Good %ra. One of our best
<ce>                      catburglars in ___contact_
<ce>                   is holed up in a rat-trap called
<ce>                       __contact_. On %g3 person
<ce>                     is a hot stone %g lifted from
<ce>                   the palace. Now the word is that
<ce>                    someone saw it on %g2, and the
<ce>                   guards are casing the place. Out
<ce>                      of respect for the owner of
<ce>                      __contact_, they're waiting
<ce>                    =1stparton_ days before moving
<ce>                      in. Get over to __contact_
<ce>                          and give _contact_
<ce>                 this hunk of _metal_ in exchange for
<ce>                  the _gems_, and then you bring the
<ce>                     it back here. You understand?
<ce>                  Good. Now, hurry, there ain't time.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                        Good to see you, %pcf,
<ce>                     but you ain't supposed to be
<ce>                     empty-handed. You're supposed
<ce>                      to have a _gems_, remember?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      Good job, %pcf. I hear that
<ce>                         _contact_ showed the
<ce>               guards the piece of _metal_ they thought
<ce>                   was a _gems_, and they bought %g2
<ce>                  a drink as an apology. I tell you,
<ce>                   ain't no life like the life of a
<ce>                  scoundrel. Here's your share of the
<ce>                  _gems_ -- _reward_ gold. You earned
<ce>                               it, %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Well, everyone knows that _contact_ stole that jewel. Why don't they get %g2?
<--->
There's a lot of poshes at __contact_. Guards aren't wanted in there.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The guards finally got _contact_. Guess %g couldn't hold 'em out forever.
<--->
Yeah, they found the %t's _gems_ and arrested that =contact_ alright.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
They had to let _contact_ go after all. Turns out %g was innocent.
<--->
Now how do you mistake _metal_ for a _gems_? They're both rocks, but come on!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
What is it, %pcf? Want that _gems_ back? I bet you do!

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      Don't you remember that you
<ce>                 were s'posed to get that _gems_ from
<ce>                      _contact_, and give %g2 the
<ce>                       _metal_ I gave you? %oth!
<ce>                   You'd think it was hard science.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                   %oth, %pcf, you're a life saver.
<ce>                    Turns out someone saw me with a
<ce>                _gems_ and they figure it's the stolen
<ce>                   gem. This hunk of _metal_ will be
<ce>                  my ticket out of here. Remind me to
<ce>                  buy you a drink sometime. Now hurry
<ce>                         back to _questgiver_.
<ce>                  They're gonna be real suspicious if
<ce>                 you're not back in =1stparton_ days.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of
 the Thieves Guild in ___questgiver_
 has sent me to ___contact_
 to a dive called __contact_.
 I have a _metal_ I am
 supposed to give _contact_
 in exchange for the stolen rock %g
 was seen with. I have =1stparton_
 days to get this done.

Message:  1020
<ce>                      I have it on good authority
<ce>                       that you have the _gems_
<ce>                         that _contact_ stole.
<ce>                       Hand it over and I'll let
<ce>                           you go unharmed.
