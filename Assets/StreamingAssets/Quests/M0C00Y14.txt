<ce>                         My name is _qgiver_.
<ce>             We only give jobs to guild members. However,
<ce>               from time to time there are jobs that are
<ce>                too menial for fighters of the guild to
<ce>               accept. I have one such job. If you take
<ce>              it, it will show that you really want to be
<ce>                  on our good side. What do you say?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Obviously you have no love for the
<ce>                 Fighter's Guild. I will make sure to
<ce>                   tell them what you really think.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Giant rats have infested _house_.
<ce>                There may be as many as half a dozen of
<ce>                 them. Go there and kill them all and
<ce>               I'll see what strings I can pull on your
<ce>                 behalf. I can only give you one day.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Killing rats, even giant ones,
<ce>                      doesn't take much skill. It
<ce>                      does put you in favor with
<ce>                         us though. Good work.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                   Some idiot bought four barrels of
<ce>                  cheese. Now he's got giant rats in
<ce>                              his house.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                  Some woman had to abandon her home.
<ce>                It was overrun with giant rats and she
<ce>                  didn't have enough gold to pay the
<ce>                     Fighters Guild to kill them.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 I heard the Fighters Guild sent some
<ce>                   %ra over to kill the rats in that
<ce>                 woman's home. They didn't even charge
<ce>                              her for it.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                 So you killed the rats. Don't get too
<ce>                full of yourself. They were only rats.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 You couldn't even take care of giant
<ce>                     rats. You are hopeless %pcn.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt: The Fighters
 Guild of ___qgiver_ has
 offered to let me rid _house_
 of a giant rat infestation.
 I have one day to get it done.

Message:  1011
<ce>  This building smells terribly of rats.
<ce>  Your entry has likely disturbed them into activity.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   That's most of them. The Fighters
<ce>                  Guild won't quibble over the rest.
