<ce>                  The Mages Guild has come to us for
<ce>                   a bit of messy business that's too
<ce>                    gross and nasty for them to deal
<ce>                     with. A renegade mage needs an
<ce>                      accounting fast. Interested?
                                     <--->
<ce>                 We have the Mages Guild for a client
<ce>                  again. Seems that one of their boys
<ce>                  has been sniffing too much bat gut,
<ce>                     and has gone off on a rampage.
<ce>                        Sound interesting, %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                         That's disappointing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Good. Now, this mage -- the name is
<ce>                             =mage_ -- has
<ce>               absconded with a number of magic thingies
<ce>                but the Mages Guild doesn't mind if you
<ce>                 take whatever %g has stolen. They just
<ce>              want %g2 dead. And you've only got =queston_
<ce>                    days to bring in the accounting.
<ce>                You'll find %g2 cowering down in a nasty
<ce>                       place called ___mondung_.
<ce>              Get back here with the world minus one rogue
<ce>                 mage in =queston_ days. Mephala steady
<ce>                            your arm, %pct.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   So, you put the spark out of that
<ce>                         Sparkcaster, %pcf? Ah,
<ce>                  Mephala is pleased with you, as are
<ce>                             her children.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The Mages Guild denies that =mage_ is beyond their control.
<--->
The Order of the Lamp is too official an organization to deal with =mage_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
=mage_ has fled across the Bay. Who can say what %g3 plans are?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
=mage_, the common people say, was done in by the Order of the Lamp.
<--->
Who can say what would've happened if that _mage_ had been suffered to live.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Greeting and salutations. How may =qgiver_ assist thee, slayer of mages?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>               You have failed your contract with us, so
<ce>               we have failed our contract with the Mages
<ce>               Guild. I have little but scorn for you at
<ce>                            this time, %pcf.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Dark Brotherhood
 in __qgiver_, ___qgiver_
 has sent me to ___mondung_
 to deal with a renegade mage from
 the Mages Guild. I've =queston_ days to
 put the matter to rest.

Message:  1011
<ce>                    =mage_'s light is snuffed out.
<ce>          The Brotherhood and the Mages Guild will be pleased.
