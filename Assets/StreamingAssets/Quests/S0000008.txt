QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                     %pcf, I'm glad you could meet
<ce>               me here. The Blades and your emperor need
<ce>                you again. You may or may not be aware
<ce>                that the Totem of Tiber Septim has been
<ce>               found. For a brief time Lord Woodborne of
<ce>                Wayrest had it. Where he got it from is
<ce>                still a mystery. The Blades mounted an
<ce>                assault upon Woodborne Hall to retrieve
<ce>                it. Although the Hall fell, many of our
<ce>                         number fell with it.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                 We sacked the Woodborne Hall, but the
<ce>               Totem was gone. I have reason to believe
<ce>               that Gothryd has the Totem. The Blades no
<ce>                longer have the men to mount an assault
<ce>                 on Castle Daggerfall. You have shown
<ce>                yourself to be quite adept at getting in
<ce>               and out of these places. Would you go into
<ce>               Castle Daggerfall and retrieve the Totem
<ce>                           of Tiber Septim?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                These are dark times indeed. If Gothryd
<ce>                gets the Mantella as well, Tamriel will
<ce>                      be thrown into a civil war.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   I knew I could count on you %pcf.
<ce>              The Totem is most likely in the Daggerfall
<ce>                  treasury. It is a huge room, quite
<ce>                unmistakable. I am leaving in a couple
<ce>                of days. I shall send word to you where
<ce>               you can meet me after you get the Totem.
<ce>                  Should you succeed, the Emperor has
<ce>                    instructed me to gift you with
<ce>                an artifact of great power and renown.
<ce>                             _artifact4_!

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]

 Lady Brisienna has asked me to bring her
 the Totem of Tiber Septim. It is hidden
 in the treasury of Castle Daggerfall.
 She fears that assassins are after her,
 and will send me a letter revealing her
 current whereabouts when I escape the
 castle. Whoever holds the Totem has the
 potential to control mighty Numidium and
 forge a new empire, just like Tiber Septim
 did so long ago.

Message:  1011
%pcn,
 
 Come at once to __tavern_ in
 ____tavern_. I will be waiting at
 _tavern_ for you. The fate
 of the empire could be at stake.
 
<ce>                           -- Lady Brisienna

Message:  1015
<ce>                    A voice in your head intones...
<ce>                                    
<ce>                     "You are %pcn. You are my new
<ce>            host. Know this now and resolutely. You are not
<ce>            worthy to carry the Totem of Tiber Septim. Only
<ce>             those of his blood line may carry me. I will
<ce>            give you a year and a day to accomplish this."

Message:  1017
%qdt:
 The Totem of Tiber Septim spoke to me in my
 head! It claims that only those with royal
 blood can lay claim to the Totem. It has given
 me one year and one day to decide who shall
 be its true wielder.

Message:  1020
%pcn,
 
 You are on a quest to retrieve the Totem of
 Tiber Septim. Do not deny it. My spies have
 confirmed this. The Totem is not for commoners,
 and you cannot use it. Bring the Totem to me
 and I will pay you 100,000 gold pieces.
 It is a king's ransom by any measure.
 
 You should be warned, neither Wayrest nor
 Daggerfall are loyal to the throne. I am the
 only regent on the Iliac Bay that can be trusted.
 The others will only use it to destroy me.
 
<ce>                               Akorithi
<ce>                           Queen of Sentinel

Message:  1021
Noble %pcf,
 
 My ears have picked up rumors that you are
 searching for the Totem of Tiber Septim. I
 too have hunted for this wondrous artifact
 for many years. Should you find it, I would
 pay you a healthy ransom, enough to buy your
 own ship. I will match or exceed any price
 that Gothryd or Akorithi might offer. Never
 forget your real friends.
 
<ce>                             King Eadwyre,
<ce>                              of Wayrest

Message:  1022
%pcn,
 
 You are not orcish. How could you possibly
 understand what it is like? My people are
 treated like barbarians. Slaughtered upon
 sight. Is it so unusual that we respond in
 kind? Violence begets violence.
 
 I aspire to raise my race from the mire. I
 will bring them to equal standing with the
 other races of Tamriel. To do this I must
 have the Totem of Tiber Septim. I will not
 insult you by promises that no blood will
 be shed. I do swear by my crown and by my
 heirs I shall not attempt to hold sway
 beyond the borders of Orsinium. My goal is
 not to conquer Tamriel, but to create the
 orcish homeland. I am in possession of an
 artifact that I am sure you would want to
 possess. It is yours if you but give me
 the Totem of Tiber Septim.
 
<ce>                     -- Gortwog, Warlord and King

Message:  1023
%pcn,
 
 You will soon have the Totem of Tiber Septim
 in your hands. It is forseen in the stars,
 and I have read them. Know you this. All of
 mortal stature are filled with pride and greed.
 To give the Totem to any of them is to let
 loose mortal vanity upon this world. They will
 destroy the very thing they covet.
    I have no earthly desires. I have no mortal
 pride, no petty greed. Only one such as I
 can wield the Totem safely, for I would take
 it into the Aetherius and leave behind this
 earthly shell. So long as the Totem exists,
 it is a danger to all on Tamriel. Bring me
 the Totem and I will safeguard the world.
    I will not offer you gold or gems. I will
 offer you what only I can give. Fame. Your
 reputation throughout Tamriel will soar.
 
<ce>                       Lord of the Necromancers,
<ce>                           King of the Worms

Message:  1024
%pcn,
 
 Centuries ago, Tiber Septim ruled the land
 and forged an empire with great Numidium. The
 secret of Numidium's power lies in its heart,
 carried within the Mantella. It is the heart
 of Tiber Septim's battlemage. It is my heart. It
 is my Mantella. It is my Totem. It belongs to
 me, and to none other.
 
 I have won and lost an empire. I have no desire
 to tamper further with mortal affairs. I have in
 my possession the _artifact2_, one of the
 world's greatest artifacts. You may have it in
 in exchange for the Totem.
 
 My most loyal agent will await your arrival in
 __temple_ of ____temple_,
 at _temple_.
 
<ce>                               Underking

Message:  1025
%pcn,
 
 If you are reading this, you must have gotten
 the Totem and escaped from the dungeons of
 Castle Daggerfall. I am in __newplace_,
 of ____newplace_ at _newplace_.
 Bring the Totem there as soon as possible.
 
<ce>                           -- Lady Brisienna

Message:  1030
<ce>            A page dressed in the livery of Sentinel hands
<ce>                you a letter, and silently walks away.

Message:  1031
<ce>             A portly man bearing the standard of Wayrest
<ce>               approaches you with a letter. His somber
<ce>              expression never changes, and he speaks not
<ce>             a word. He leaves as silently as he arrived.

Message:  1032
<ce>             A heavily cloaked figure shuffles toward you.
<ce>             As you prepare to defend yourself, a gnarled
<ce>            green hand shoots forth with a letter. Stunned,
<ce>              you do nothing as the figure shuffles away.

Message:  1033
<ce>            A hand grips your wrist from behind. Spinning,
<ce>             you open your mouth to shout for the guards.
<ce>           A skeletal hand stuffs a letter into your mouth.
<ce>            The heavily robed skeleton releases your wrist
<ce>             and turns away, unnoticed by other passerby.

Message:  1034
<ce>              A letter floats through the air toward you.
<ce>              Strangely, nobody else seems to notice it.
<ce>                The letter tucks itself into your pack.

Message:  1040
<ce>              Hand over the Totem, or we'll slaughter you
<ce>             where you stand. Well? Are you going to give
<ce>                it to us, or make us take it from you?

Message:  1041
<ce>                   Then we'll just have to take it.

Message:  1042
<ce>                 Coward. Now get lost. Oh yeah. I was
<ce>                    told you should go see Nalfuga,
<ce>                           whoever that is.

Message:  1043
<ce>               You don't even have it! Now I'm going to
<ce>                   kill you just for the fun of it.

Message:  1050
<ce>             The Totem of Tiber Septim! It is a priceless
<ce>             artifact. I shall guard it well and keep the
<ce>              rebellious powers of Daggerfall and Wayrest
<ce>                 in check. Take your reward %pcf. You
<ce>              have earned it ten fold. You must keep your
<ce>              keen eyes open for the Mantella. Any rumors
<ce>              must be hunted down with vigor. Without the
<ce>                    Mantella, the Totem is useless.

Message:  1051
<ce>              Fool! Did you really think I would pay you
<ce>                     for the Totem? Kill the %ra!

Message:  1052
<ce>               A nation of Orcs is within my grasp. You
<ce>               have given my people a chance at freedom,
<ce>                     %pcn. Should you ever recover
<ce>                the Mantella itself, I shall reward you
<ce>                          thrice over for it.

Message:  1053
<ce>             I see you have come to your senses. I should
<ce>           have you slain, but I have more honor than that.
<ce>           Instead I shall reward you. Here take _goldgoth_
<ce>            gold pieces for your turnabout loyalty. Deliver
<ce>             the Mantella to me, and my trust in you will
<ce>                        be once again restored.

Message:  1054
<ce>               The Totem! At last it is within my grasp.
<ce>                   You have done well, %pcf. I shall
<ce>                remember this when I have transformed.
<ce>               Search now for the Mantella. Without it,
<ce>               the Totem is worthless. In the mean time,
<ce>                   enjoy the adoration of the world.

Message:  1055
<ce>                The Underking will be most pleased. He
<ce>              has searched many life times for this lost
<ce>             item. I have been instructed to give you this
<ce>             object. Use it wisely. Should you ever locate
<ce>               the Mantella, the Underking would be most
<ce>                             appreciative.

Message:  1056
<ce>             Your Emperor will be most grateful. The Totem
<ce>              could have started a civil war in the wrong
<ce>                  hands. Thank you %pcf. Now you must
<ce>               away to Nulfaga. She holds the key to the
<ce>             Mantella. Free the Mantella, and the Emperor
<ce>              controls Great Numidium through the Totem.

Message:  1060
<ce>               The unmistakable voice of Nulfaga speaks
<ce>              softly in your head, "I see that the Totem
<ce>              has found its way into the hands of someone
<ce>               with royal blood. I think it is time you
<ce>               paid me another visit here in Shedungent
<ce>                   %pcn. Your work is not yet done."

Message:  1070
<ce>               A cheerful young woman hands you a letter
<ce>                    and then walks away, whistling.
