<ce>                      You may be aware that I am
<ce>                        forming an alliance with
<ce>                       _qgfriend_. To cement our
<ce>                       friendship, I have agreed
<ce>                        to arrange the death of
<ce>                         a consistent threat to
<ce>                          %g2 -- some sort of
<ce>                      monster. This foul parasite
<ce>                        lives in a decrepit old
<ce>                       place called ___mondung_.
<ce>                          %g has agreed to pay
<ce>                    the creature's assassin _reward_
<ce>                        gold in return. Not too
<ce>                      bad, I'm sure you'll agree.
<ce>                        So, does this sound like
<ce>                       your sort of an adventure,
<ce>                                 %pcn?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Really? How inconsiderate of you to leave me in
<ce>                          the lurch like this.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Recognize a good deal when
<ce>                        you hear it, eh? I told
<ce>                      _qgfriend_ that the monster
<ce>                   would be dead in =1stparton_ days
<ce>                      or %g could go out and hire
<ce>                       someone else. So kill the
<ce>                        creature and get over to
<ce>                         ___qgfriend_ and find
<ce>                     %g2 before the time runs out.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     Better get on the road, %pcf.
<ce>                             Time is short.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Yes, I've already heard word that our
<ce>                _giant_ pestilence is at an end. I don't
<ce>                     know where _questgiver_ found
<ce>             you, but I'm glad %g did. Here's your _reward_
<ce>                 gold piece reward. Thank you for your
<ce>                             service, %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There's a monster in ___mondung_ that's been bothering _qgfriend_.
<--->
That monster in ___mondung_ has a horde of bats and rats apparently.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Now that monster =giant_ knows its lair is known, it's moved on.
<--->
<ce>           The monster =giant_ has moved out of ___mondung_,
<ce>                     but still plagues _qgfriend_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The curse of =giant_ has finally been wiped from %reg.
<--->
A holy %ra warrior has destroyed =giant_, blight of our land.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, my friend, =giant_'s nemesis! What may I do for you?
<--->
<ce>           You have aided me in forming my alliances, %pcf.
<ce>                       With what can I help you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   Your failure to slay that monster
<ce>                  complicated matters. I have no time
<ce>                            for such as you.

Message:  1011
<ce>                   =qgfriend_, yes? A possible ally
<ce>                     of _questgiver_ with a problem
<ce>                    with that thing in ___mondung_.
                                     <--->
_qgfriend_ is the blood enemy of =giant_.

Message:  1012
You have slain =giant_.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
_questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_ hired me on behalf
 of an ally, _qgfriend_ of
 ___qgfriend_, to slay a
 monster known only as =giant_, which
 has been terrorizing the land around
 ___mondung_. If the monster is dead
 and I have made it to _qgfriend_ in =1stparton_
 days, I will earn my reward.

Message:  1021
<ce>                   Oh, I almost forgot. I don't know
<ce>                what kind of monster haunts ___mondung_,
<ce>                 but the name =giant_ has been rumored
<ce>                    to be the source of the terror.

Message:  1030
<ce>               Who dares disturb =giant_ the Terrible in
<ce>               %g3 lair?  Your skull will soon hang on my
<ce>                           wall as a trophy!
