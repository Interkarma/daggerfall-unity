<ce>                       You may call me _qgiver_.
<ce>                 Normally I can only give work to guild
<ce>                members. However, one of my students has
<ce>               a minor problem that would be embarrassing
<ce>                if it were to get out. I can't pay you,
<ce>               but if you would be willing to chase down
<ce>                an escaped experiment, at small risk to
<ce>                yourself, I would be grateful enough to
<ce>              speak kindly of you to other guild members.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   So, why did you ask me for work?
<ce>                  Sometimes I really cannot understand
<ce>                        you common adventurers.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                Good. My student keeps a pet imp. These
<ce>               magical creatures are not very dangerous,
<ce>                but it could be potentially embarrassing
<ce>                for him. Our scrying has determined that
<ce>                    the imp has fled to ___mondung_.
<ce>                  Kill the thing and report back to me
<ce>                        within =1stparton_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               I scried earlier today. The imp is still
<ce>                    alive. What are you doing here?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 What a relief. I owe you a small debt
<ce>                      %pcn. You have improved your
<ce>                      favor with the Mages Guild.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I hear something escaped from the Mages Guild lab the other night.
<--->
%oth, I saw a small shape skulking in the shadows last night.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Well, there's a minor scandal involving the Mages Guild's lab security.
<--->
The Mages Guild lost another experiment apparently.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear they torture imps in the Mages Guild laboratories!
<--->
<ce>                    Those imps have a mean streak.
<ce>                  %nam's house was overrun with mice,
<ce>                just for chasing after it with a broom.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 I heard an imp familiar escaped from
<ce>                the Mages Guild. They say that a wizard
<ce>                 that loses his familiar is vulnerable
<ce>                        to his enemies' spells.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
How are you, %pcf? No more troubles with imps, I hope, eh?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 I sent you off after that imp, if you
<ce>              recall. I don't see any reason why I should
<ce>                    waste my breath with you again.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                      "I would rather die than go
<ce>                        back to the Mages Guild
<ce>                              laboratory."

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 The Mages Guild of ___qgiver_
 has hired me to find an imp that
 escaped from their laboratory.
 Apparently it is hiding out in ___mondung_.
 I need to have the creature dead and be back
 in ___qgiver_ in =1stparton_ days.
