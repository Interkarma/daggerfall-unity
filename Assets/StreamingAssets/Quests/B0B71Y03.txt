<ce>                      A rumor has surfaced as to
<ce>                     the whereabouts of an ancient
<ce>                       artifact of power. This is
<ce>                          a once in a lifetime
<ce>                       opportunity. Are you up to
<ce>                               it, %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Not the ambitious type, eh?
<ce>                        Some other lucky knight
<ce>                       will be sure to snap this
<ce>                                one up.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       I thought I detected the
<ce>                       gleam of ambition in your
<ce>                         eyes %pcf. Supposedly,
<ce>                       a witch living deep in the
<ce>                         bowels of ___dungeon1_
<ce>                      has discovered a clue about
<ce>                       where to find this thing.
<ce>                          I'd start with her.

QuestComplete:  [1004]

<ce>                               complete.

I got a boil the other day ... but it healed.
<--->
I just had a three hour conversation about the weather.
<--->
The weather is pretty usual for this time of year.
<--->
It seems a trifle coolish in %cn for this time of year.
<--->
It sure is a lot warmer today than this time last year.
<--->
My great aunt is going to a specialist across the Bay.
<--->
It's always funny what time it gets dark around here.
<--->
We should erect a war statue around here.
<--->
The kids these days with their magic. %oth, I don't know.
<--->
I had the weirdest dream last night.
<--->
I heard a great joke. %jok
<--->
%jok Actually, that's a joke.
<--->
%jok Can you explain that to me?
<--->
The legal system in %reg has its good points and bad ones.

%qdt:
 I embarked upon a quest to find a legendary,
 artifact of power. The only clue
 _questgiver_ of __questgiver_
 was able to provide is that a witch hermited
 in ___dungeon1_ might know
 something about it.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 The witch, _witch_,
 in ___dungeon1_ demanded
 that I kidnap _child_,
 in _palace_, in __palace_,
 her great granddaughter, and bring her
 to the witch if I am ever to find
 _aurielsbow_.

<ce>              I am _witch_. So, you want _aurielshield_.
<ce>          It is true that I know something of it. You must do
<ce>            something for me if you wish to learn my secret.
<ce>            Long ago, when I was young and your grandfather
<ce>                  was less than a gleam in your great
<ce>             grandmother's eye, I gave birth to a daughter.
<ce>        I left the child to be raised by others, but now that my
<ce>                   powers are waning, I need an heir.
<ce>                 My daughter is long dead, but I have a
<ce>                  great granddaughter of the right age
<ce>                     named _child_. Bring her to me
<ce>         within =finddaughter_ days and I will tell you what I
<ce>               know of _aurielshield_. _child_'s parents
<ce>           know nothing of her birthright and will certainly
<ce>                    resist any attempt to take her.
<ce>                     You will find her in _palace_
<ce>                             in __palace_.
