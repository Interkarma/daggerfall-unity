<ce>                 You can't really have too much power,
<ce>                       can you, %pcf? You look a
<ce>                   lot like someone I used to know --
<ce>                  but that was back during your First
<ce>                 Era, so it couldn't very well be you,
<ce>                  could it? Now then, if you'd like, I
<ce>                  can give you a little shield of mine
<ce>                   called the Spell Breaker. It will
<ce>                 certainly give you the power you want,
<ce>                  but first, I need a little proof of
<ce>                   your seriousness. You are serious,
<ce>                              aren't you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Changed your mind, eh? Don't feel
<ce>                    bad. It's a sign of maturity to
<ce>                    be brave enough to say no. Just
<ce>                     give me a call when you change
<ce>                      your mind. I know you will.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Excellent. It's wonderful seeing a
<ce>                   %ra with clear objectives. So rare
<ce>                 in this day and age. Now then, there's
<ce>                 this _monster_, frankly a vampire, who
<ce>                 I know you'd hate. Thoroughly stupid,
<ce>                 unattractive, and mean-spirited sort.
<ce>                  He needs to go on a one-way trip to
<ce>                   you-know-where. Then, after you've
<ce>                taken care of that unpleasant business,
<ce>                    go visit my friend, _qgfriend_,
<ce>                         a charming =qgfriend_,
<ce>                    who will meet you at __qgfriend_
<ce>                     in ___qgfriend_. Now, I don't
<ce>                 want to rush you, but I can't ask %g2
<ce>                   to wait more than =1stparton_ days
<ce>                for you. And just getting to ___mondung_
<ce>                  may take a good while, so you ought
<ce>                 not dawdle along the way.  _qgfriend_
<ce>                  will be happy to show you the Spell
<ce>                  Breaker. Now, I've prattled on long
<ce>                     enough. It's been a pleasure.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       You must be looking for a
<ce>                         different =qgfriend_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         There you are, %pct.
<ce>                            I'm _qgfriend_,
<ce>              I believe the Master wanted you to find me?
<ce>               The Master is very pleased with your work
<ce>                        on the dread _monster_,
<ce>               if you don't mind me saying so. The Master
<ce>               seems very fond of you in general. Here is
<ce>               the shield you wanted, the Spell Breaker.
<ce>                  Spellcasters will come to fear you.
<ce>                        I hope it pleases, %pct.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
=monster_ of ___mondung_, they say, has made powerful enemies as well as friends.
<--->
I met a very nice =qgfriend_ at __qgfriend_. Wonder why I never met %g2 before?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Old =monster_ moved up north. So I guess we know where plague will follow.
<--->
I hear the Daedra themselves fear =monster_ and its power.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
=monster_ they say fancied itself more powerful than the daedra themselves.
<--->
=monster_ got its reward for boasting about its power over life and death.

Message:  1011
They say _qgfriend_ is a very pleasant and charming =qgfriend_, who is also a daedra-worshipper.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is rumored to be Peryite's slave in %reg.

Message:  1012
Peryite is the Daedra of Pestilence and Plague.
<--->
Peryite is the most affable of the Daedra Princes with the worst reputation.

Message:  1013
The Spell Breaker is the ultimate defense against spells.
<--->
Spell Breaker can dispel or even reflect spells back on offensive casters.

Message:  1014
<ce>                       You have slain =monster_.
<ce>                     Peryite's revenge is complete.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 The Daedra Prince Peryite wants me
 to go to ___mondung_
 and slay a vampire named =monster_
 After that, I am to meet _qgfriend_
 in a place called __qgfriend_ in
 ___qgfriend_ to claim the famous
 Spell Breaker shield.  I have =1stparton_
 days for the whole journey.
