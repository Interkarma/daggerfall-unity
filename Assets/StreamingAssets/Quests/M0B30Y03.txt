<ce>                   Something's come up. I don't know
<ce>                   who else could handle it but you,
<ce>                          %pcf. There's this
<ce>                      bad critter in ___mondung_,
<ce>                   a Daedroth. Now, I ain't lying --
<ce>                   no one knows why it's there, but
<ce>                 everyone wants it gone. For _reward_
<ce>                   gold, you think you could handle
<ce>                               it, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       I don't blame you, %pcf.
<ce>                      I wouldn't wanna take on a
<ce>                           Daedroth either.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Hey, alright, your funeral, %pcf.
<ce>                  Listen, knock off that Daedroth and
<ce>                 get back here in =1stparton_ days for
<ce>                  your reward. I don't know how long
<ce>                that thing's gonna be around, so you're
<ce>                   gonna want to move your ass. And
<ce>                      listen to me on this, %pcf --
<ce>                 go prepared for a hell of a fight.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   Are you waiting for that Daedroth
<ce>                       to die of old age, %pcf?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       Hey, you're a better %ra
<ce>                    than me, %pcf. Daedroth-killer.
<ce>                     I like it. Here's your gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I don't know what that big lizard thing is in ___mondung_, but I don't like it.
<--->
Everyone's talking about that big, nasty thing over in ___mondung_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I don't know what happened to that Daedroth. It's still around here somewhere.
<--->
Liked it best when I knew where the Daedroth was. I don't know where's safe.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Thank %god the Fighters Guild is around to take care of Daedroths.
<--->
I wonder what that big nasty lizard thing was anyway.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                 You're the %ra that slew the Daedroth
<ce>                        in ___mondung_ for me.
<ce>                        Let me shake your hand.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  Failure is not taken lightly in the
<ce>                Fighter's Guild. If you couldn't handle
<ce>                 a Daedroth, you shouldn't have taken
<ce>                 the job. I've got better things to do
<ce>                  than waste my time talking to you.

Message:  1020
<ce>                         The Daedroth is dead.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild in
 ___questgiver_ will pay me _reward_ gold pieces
 if I slay the Daedroth in ___mondung_ in
 =1stparton_ days or less.

-lowered first line of 1030 from %qdt line

Message:  1080
<ce>                 Since you didn't even blink at offing
<ce>               a Daedroth, take this map to ___newdung_.
<ce>                  Plenty of fun for a %pct like you.
