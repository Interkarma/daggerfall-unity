<ce>                          Our sister _witch_
<ce>                    has been imprisoned. We need
<ce>                   someone like thee to rescue her.
<ce>                           Art thou willing?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       Thou hast a heart of ice,
<ce>                           %pcf. For shame.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   If thou does this for us, we will
<ce>                   be very grateful indeed. Give her
<ce>                  these clothes to disguise her when
<ce>                     you find her in ___mondung_.
<ce>                 We will expect both of you back here
<ce>                   in =queston_ days if not sooner.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                          _witch_, it does my
<ce>                 heart good to see thee here and well.
<ce>                         %pcf, you have today
<ce>                         earned the respect of
<ce>                              ==qgiver_.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
After they've finished interrogating _witch_, she's fire food.
<--->
There's going to be a hanging or a burning for _witch_ real soon.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_witch_'s execution was quite a sight. Fun for the whole family.
<--->
_witch_ is just ash now. All her spells couldn't help her.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_witch_ got away. They say ==qgiver_ was behind it.
<--->
_witch_ was never brought to justice. Never even really tortured.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
_witch_ is recovering nicely, %pcf, you'll be glad to know.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                          Our sister _witch_
<ce>                    is dead, burned alive. Perhaps
<ce>                   thou could've saved her, perhaps
<ce>                  not. But you are not welcome here.
<ce>                  Perhaps not for quite a long time.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 ==qgiver_ have sent
 me to ___mondung_
 where _witch_, a
 sister of the witches has been
 imprisoned. I am to give her
 a _clothes_ to disguise
 her, and return to ==qgiver_
 before =queston_ days
 have passed.

Message:  1011
<ce>                          ==qgiver_ sent you?
<ce>                        Praise ==daedra_! I'll
<ce>                         put on the _clothes_
<ce>                     and we can slip out of here.

Message:  1012
<ce>                          "It's _witch_, the
<ce>                        prisoner! Stop! Witch!"

<ce>                           _witch_! Straight
<ce>                       to execution this time!"

<ce>                               _witch_!"

<ce>                         ==qgiver_ from here,"
<ce>                          _witch_ thanks you
<ce>                         and goes on her way.
