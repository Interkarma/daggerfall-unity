[/center]The Wild Elves



[/font=4]



 In the wilds of most every province of Tamriel, descended
philosophically if not directly from the original
inhabitants of the land are the Ayleids, commonly called the
Wild Elves. While three races of elven stock, Salache (or
High), Boiche (or Wood), and Moriche (or Dark) have
assimilated well to the new cultures of Tamriel, the
Ayleids and their brethren have remained aloof of our
civilization, preferring to practice the old ways far from
the eyes of the world.

 The Wild Elves speak a variation of Old Cyrodilic and not
Tamrielic, separating themselves further even than their
more urbanized Elven cousins. In temperament they are
dark-spirited and taciturn, though they doubtless act
differently with outsiders (or "Pellani" in their tongue)
than within their own tribes. Indeed, one of the finest sages
of the University of Gwilym was a civilized Ayleid elf,
Tjurhane Fyrre (1E 2790 - 2E 227) whose published work on Wild
Elves suggests a lively, vibrant culture. Fyrre is one of
the very few Ayleids to speak freely on his people and
religion, and even he said "the nature of the tribes of Ayleid
are multi-hued, their personalities often wildly different
from their neighbor tribes." (Fyrre, T. "Nature of Ayleidic
Poesy" p. 8, Univ of Gwilym Press, 2E 12) Like any alien
culture, Wild Elves are often feared by the simple people
of Tamriel.

 The Ayleids continue to be one of the greatest enigmas of the
continent of Tamriel. They seldom appear in the pages of
written history in any role, and then only as a strange sight
a chronicler stumbles upon before they vanish into the wood.
When probable fiction is filtered from common legend, we
are left with almost nothing. The mysterious ways of the
Ayleids have remained shrouded since before the first era, and
may well remain so for thousands of years to come.
