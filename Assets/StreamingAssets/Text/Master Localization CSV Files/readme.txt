These are the localization "master" CSV files.
Data in these CSVs is an export of built-in string tables.

To use:
* Copy required CSVs from "StreamingAssets/Text/Master Localization CSV Files" into "StreamingAssets/Text".
* Edit the required text in "Value" column with translated strings.
* Do not change the "Key" column as this used by game to lookup string values.

Fonts:
* If you require non-Latin characters, add your custom TTF or OTF font into "StreamingAssets/Fonts".
* Custom fonts must be renamed using format "FONT0000-SDF", "FONT0001-SDF", "FONT0002-SDF", etc.
* Characters in custom fonts must use standard Unicodes for your character set.
