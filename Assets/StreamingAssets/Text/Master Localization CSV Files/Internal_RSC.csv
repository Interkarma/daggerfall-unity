Even though freelance whoremasters, pickpockets, catburglars, swindlers, and muggers exist, most professional criminals in Tamriel belong to the Thieves Guild. It is best for the collective whole, and the Guild exerts a certain ... pressure to join.[/record]
In practically every borough, hamlet, and city-state in Tamriel, the professional criminals have bounded together for mutual protection. That's the Thieves Guild for you.[/record]
The Thieves Guild is just like any other guild -- it's just that their particular industry is crime. They offer special benefits to their members, bribe officials, and punish non-members. Just like any other guild.[/end]"
861,"The Mages Guild is the official center of magical study in Tamriel. Most major towns have a bureau of the Guild where they sell spells and magical items, in addition to their studies.[/record]
The Mages Guild is sorta a school for studying spells. You have to already be pretty decent to get in, but even non-members can use some of their services.[/record]
The Mages Guild is pretty much what the name suggests. It's an organization for all varieties of spellcasters to get together and teach each other. Used to be that mages were solitary types. No longer.[/record]
It's just what you think it is. A school and a club for mages who are already pretty good to make them even better. It's been around for, oh, at least a thousand years.[/end]"

A bunch of assassins posing as a religious order.[/record]
They're more or less the official Assassin's Guild of Tamriel. Most kingdoms have declared them to be an illegal organization, but it's one thing to make a declaration ...[/record]
They're sorta a religious group, but not like a temple. Imagine a bunch of priests with knives and blood on the mind.[/end]"
863,"Many orders have their mysteries, but everything about the Blades is shrouded in myth. They are rumored to be the finest warriors in Tamriel, trained for generation after generation, all within the same families. What their goals are is completely unknown.[/record]
They may not even exist, but if they do, and the legends have a basis in truth, they're the finest warriors in all Tamriel.[/record]
They're a knightly order alright, but unlike any other order, which defines itself by its allegiance, the Blades' master is unknown. They are a completely enigmatic group.[/record]
You shouldn't be asking about the Blades so openly. Everyone knows that they're made up of the best fighters in Tamriel, but no one knows the purpose for their existence. That makes them dangerous.[/end]"
864,"The Necromancers are the dark mirror of the Mages Guild, powerful magicka casters who are masters of the most corruptive and daedric of spells. They are said to be led by a man they call the King of Worms. According to common rumor, he is thousands of years old and not aging at all.[/record]
It is best not to even talk about the Necromancers. Unlike the Mages Guild, they are devoted to a singular cause. But despite horror stories to the contrary, no one knows what this cause may be.[/record]
The Necromancers are wizards, like the Mages Guild, but far, far more secretive. Their goals and their activities are whispered about, but no one but a Necromancer knows for certain what they are.[/record]
There's an old saying that when opposing the Necromancers, you fear what comes after death more than death itself. They are dangerous wizards, and it is best that the virtuous have little to do with them.[/end]"
865,"The Underking is the old bugbear of childhood stories, said to be the most powerful mage who ever lived. The stories go back to the earliest years of the Septim dynasty. No one, however, doubts the existence of those who call themselves his Agents. The living and the animated dead who say they answer to the Underking are perhaps in the hundreds.[/record]
The Underking is, well, sort of like a lich. A very powerful, very mysterious ancient lich. Now, where does he live and what does he want? That I can't tell you.[/record]
According to some stories, the Underking was once a powerful wizard who gave up his heart for some worthy enterprise. The heart disappeared, so the Underking cannot die or really live. But his minions do his bidding with fanatical devotion, supposedly still searching for his heart.[/record]
The Underking may be nothing more than a myth, but his minions are very real. The common people of Tamriel definitely believe in the Underking, and fear him greatly.[/end]"
866,"The Fighters Guild is a sophisticated mercenary service. They often hire out adventurers as guards, escorts, and, occasionally, on more covert missions.[/record]
Just a bunch of guards for hire, nothing mysterious or romantic.[/record]
The Fighters Guild is just what its name implies -- an order for lances for hire and other mercenaries.[/record]
The Fighters Guild is where everyone with any gold goes to hire additional guards, escorts, what-have-you. They are absolutely essential for getting things done in %reg.[/end]"
867,The Order of the Lamp is the knightly order that protects the less combative oriented members of the Mages Guild.[/end]

870,"Any temple dedicated to Zenithar, the God of Work and Commerce, is called a Resolution of Zenithar or a Resolution of Zen.[/record]
A Resolution is the fancy name the priests of Zenithar give to their temples.[/record]
Zenithar is the God of Work and Commerce. A no-nonsense kind of deity, and His temples are so headstrong, they're called Resolutions.[/end]"
871,"Temples devoted to the Mother-Goddess Mara are customarily called Benevolences because she is also the Goddess of Love.[/record]
A Benevolence is any temple devoted to the Mother-Goddess, Mara.[/record]
Mara's temples are called Benevolences, just like the God of Work and Commerce calls His temples Resolutions. She's the Mother-Goddess and the Goddess of Love, so it makes sense in a way.[/record]
"
872,"The Akatosh Chantry is one of the temples dedicated to the Dragon, the God of Time, Akatosh.[/record]
The priests of Akatosh always call their temples chantries. I suppose it's because they do a lot of singing there.[/record]
Akatosh is a Dragon God of Time, and the temples devoted to Him are always called Chantries.[/end]"
873,"Julianos is the God of Wisdom and Logic, and His temples are called Schools.[/record]
They don't really worship Julianos at His temples, but since He is the God of Wisdom, they run the temples more like academies. That's why they call them Schools, not temples.[/record]
The School of Julianos is one of the top research institutions in Tamriel, probably second only to the Mages Guild. There's a lot of rivalry between the Mages and the scholars of Julianos, actually.[/end]"
874,"The Temple of Stendarr is dedicated to the God Stendarr, the Patron of Mercy. They are among the greatest charitable institutions in the land.[/record]
Stendarr is the God of Mercy and His temples attempt to carry His message of peace to all Tamriel. You can judge their success for yourself.[/record]
The cult devoted to the God of Mercy and Peace is called the Temple of Stendarr. Say what you want about them, they have an honest vision of a peaceful Tamriel.[/end]"

Come water of Rains Hand, come with speed[/record]
Thou noblest specie, thou finest breed[/record]
Love is my religion, but sorrow my creed[/record]

I kiss your lips and your neck so fair[/record]
Love makes us reckless, without care[/record]
Such boldness of passion do I dare[/record]
And how, my love, doth thou fare?[/record]
Sunshine in Mid Year shines your hair[/record]
He was her stallion, she his mare[/record]
Together, they walk down to the square[/record]
You never have seen a prettier pair![/record]
O goddess Mara, acknowledge my prayer![/record]
Bathed in sunlight, sunlight to wear[/record]
On moonlight and stars, lovers do swear[/record]
My love to thee I do sadly declare[/record]

My goddess, O Mara, I do plea[/record]
What does it mean to be truly free?[/record]
Add one to us, love, and make three[/record]
Birds chatter love songs in their tree[/record]
But you, my love, are far across the sea[/record]
You give yourself and I give myself to thee[/record]
So it was stated by Mara's decree[/record]
No fool doth love ever guarantee[/record]

You drowned within the raging sea[/record]
I brought your soul inside of me[/end]"

Thy hair night-black, thy eyes bright as day[/record]
With a nonny, nonny, nonny, nonny, hey![/record]
On a bough of flowers, my body lay[/record]
Like children, in gold fields we play[/record]
What price for love we fools do pay![/record]
Like clouds fore the storm, I turn gray[/record]
My darling, beside me please stay![/record]
My love like a strong branch ne'er will sway[/record]
Flowers you pluck to make your bouquet[/record]
The dancers begin their sad ballet[/record]
Now let us sport while we may[/record]
My love, thou art so far far away[/record]
A thousand wasted hours every day[/record]
Would thou simply throw me away?[/end]"
920,"Sweet day, so cool, so calm and bright[/record]
Shelter yourself from jealousy's bite[/record]
Peace, my love, I weary of the fight[/record]
Let us hold our love up to the light[/record]
Harvests come of plenty and blight[/record]
Pity not me my sorrowful plight![/record]
Struggle we do with all our might[/record]
She was his lady and he her knight[/record]
Walketh thou in beauty like the night[/record]
Thou paineth me of jealous spite[/record]
I curse my eyes for their sight[/record]
I spy in the field a horse so white[/record]
Come my love, come at twilight[/record]
Of thee, dear, I do delight[/record]
I am in the room without a light[/record]
I would give anything to hold you tight[/record]
I would love to take you home tonight[/record]
Take me in your arms this very night[/end]"
921,"Thus sang the uncouth swain[/record]
Thy love is like a sweet, sweet bane[/record]
If this be love, I cannot feign[/record]
Bring me the knife that I be slain[/record]
Why must love bring so much pain?[/record]
In my heart a tyrant doth reign[/record]
Thou left me standing in the rain[/record]
How, my love, can thou be vain?[/record]
The fickle moon doth wax and wane[/record]
My heart is broke again in twain[/record]
Forces occult, daedric, arcane[/record]
With words, I to you enchain[/record]
You look to me with true disdain[/record]
How can I pray hope regain?[/record]
Perhaps, my love, I should explain[/record]
How do lovers from love abstain?[/record]
Thou came to me like a hurricane[/record]
I can see through thy legerdemain[/record]
I am plagued with thoughts inane[/record]
I only hope I might entertain[/record]

it. However, He does bless those who generously[/center]
donate to His School with a temporary increase in[/center]
their magical skills.[/center]

While we advocate literacy and education for all[/center]
Tamrielans, our policy for those who wish to join[/center]

Your mother, a beautiful enchantress, would entertain[/left]
you for hours with tricks. Your favorite was her[/left]
%q1[/left]
Your father was a fearsome man. Many in the village[/left]
referred to him as ""that Warlock."" But to you he was a[/left]
loving and doting father.[/left]
[/left]
As you grew, it was apparent that you had unusually strong[/left]
magical powers. Soon you were able to %q1a[/left]
yourself. You remember your parents talking about an evil[/left]
Battlemage, Jagar Tharn, how it was known in their circle[/left]
that he had usurped the power of the land away from its[/left]
rightful ruler. No one dared to move against him.[/left]

One day in your twentieth year, a courier arrived at your[/left]
house with the news that a powerful hero had killed[/left]
Jagar Tharn and restored the rightful Emperor to the throne.[/left]

[/left]
The courier also brought the news that there would be a great[/left]
celebration in Imperial City and that all the people who had[/left]
worked secretly to depose Tharn were invited. Once the[/left]
courier left, you asked your parents if you could go to the[/left]
celebration. Your mother and father looked concerned and[/left]
explained that there was not enough gold for all three of you[/left]
to make the trip. Downcast, you tried to hide your[/left]
disappointment. Your father, however, turned to you and said[/left]
that it was time you made your own way in the world. He gave[/left]
you %q4 and a very unusual staff[/left]
and sent you on your way to the Imperial City and the[/left]
celebration.[/left]

After many days of travel, you approached the capital of the[/left]

travelers only a short distance in front of you. As you were[/left]
about to hail them, they were attacked by brigands who had[/left]
been lying in wait in the woods along the road. You rushed[/left]
to help the other travelers. As you approached, one of the[/left]
brigands raised his short sword to strike you. In a natural[/left]
reflex, you tried to deflect the blow with the staff your[/left]
father gave you. As the sword struck the staff, a great bolt[/left]
of lightning erupted from it and both weapons shattered. The[/left]
brigands and the travelers all stopped and stared at you.[/left]
As the thunder subsided, the brigands ran back into the[/left]
woods. You were mobbed by the travelers who thanked you[/left]
profusely for saving them, members of the Imperial Family[/left]
who had been visiting in the country and were returning to[/left]
the Imperial City for the celebrations. They insisted that[/left]
you come with them to the palace and have an audience with the[/left]
Emperor.[/left]

The Emperor was very impressed by your bravery and knew[/left]
your family as loyal supporters of the Empire. He presented[/left]
you with %q5. The celebrations continued for weeks,[/left]

4121,"Though your childhood was similar to that of other[/left]
%ra children you knew, at age 10, your[/left]
father thought you ready to begin learning thieving[/left]
skills. You spent many happy hours in his work shop,[/left]
practicing initially %q1.[/left]
Your skills developed slowly at first, and your father[/left]
seemed to have to suppress his impatience at times.[/left]
[/left]
You applied yourself to your training more diligently[/left]
than ever. It gradually became apparent to both you[/left]
and your father that while you certainly would[/left]
become a competent thief given time, you would never[/left]
achieve his level of mastery.[/left]
[/left]
While you were studying %q3 techniques[/left]
with your father, your mother began to teach you, in[/left]
her quiet way, the use of magicka. It did not[/left]
take long to determine that you had some definite[/left]
potential. You discovered that you could use both[/left]
sciences together, using the discipline from[/left]
your %q3 and %q4[/left]
training to accelerate your development of[/left]
%q2 spells.[/left]
[/left]
Your mother introduced you to some unusual, non-human[/left]
creatures, mostly %q5.[/left]
You learned not only not to fear them, but also some of[/left]
their language. One in particular, a female named %fn[/left]
took a liking to you and trained you further in spells[/left]
of %q6 than your mother ever could.[/left]
[/left]
One night, your father brought you into his shop, a[/left]
serious expression on his face. He explained that an[/left]
agent of the Emperor himself had approached the[/left]
heads of the local Thieves and Mages Guild. He had told[/left]
them that the Emperor had heard rumors of a[/left]
%q8 named %bn who was supposed to[/left]
have been allied with the imperial traitor Jagar Tharn.[/left]
The Emperor dared not act against %bn[/left]
without proper evidence to verify his illegal actions.[/left]
Your father suggested that, as a pair, you two were just[/left]
right for the assignment. Excited about the chance[/left]
to impress your father as much as the Emperor's reward,[/left]
you agreed at once.[/left]
[/left]
Some nights later, you and your father broke into[/left]
%bn's study and began searching for[/left]
evidence of conspiracy. A noise out in the hall[/left]
nearly caused you to drop the stack of papers you were[/left]
carrying. Quickly, as agreed before, you moved off to the[/left]
exit route carrying %bn's materials[/left]
while your father headed off to provide a distraction. He[/left]
gave you a wink and disappeared. You left the castle, and[/left]
followed the escape route to your home.[/left]
[/left]
There, a portly mage and an Imperial courier examined the[/left]
materials, and from their reactions, the evidence damned[/left]
%bn. You sat with your mother and[/left]
fretfully awaited your father's return. The hours turned[/left]
to days, and you numbly realized that you would never see[/left]
your father again. The receipt of the Emperor's reward[/left]
seemed small consolation for your loss.[/left]
[/left]
Some weeks later, a letter bearing the Imperial seal[/left]
arrived at your house. You were requested in the Imperial[/left]
City at once.[/left]
[/end]"
4122,"Your parents travelled with a carnival throughout your youth,[/left]
so you were exposed to the best and worst of Tamriel. From your[/left]
mother you learned how to %q1.[/left]
From your father you learned many things -- how to[/left]
%q2, to %q3,[/left]
and the rudiments of %q4.[/left]
All could be used for defense as well as entertainment.[/left]
[/left]
The years between your tenth and twentieth birthdays are among[/left]
the worst Tamriel has ever suffered. The carnival was not such[/left]
a happy place, and movement within the land was severely[/left]
restricted. Agents of the Emperor would search the countryside[/left]
for enemies of the Empire and would question all quite rudely.[/left]
You always hoped that such a refugee would make his way to the[/left]
carnival, and then one day, one did. When the bedraggled young[/left]
man was hidden away, you had your opportunity to have fun with[/left]
the Imperial agents. Gleefully, you convinced half of the agents[/left]
that you were their commanding officer in disguise and sent[/left]
them after the other agents, insisting they were double-[/left]
agents. It turned out to be your last prank. You were[/left]
shortly after jailed as an enemy of the Emperor.[/left]
[/left]
When the true Emperor took his throne back from the usurper[/left]
Jagar Tharn, all political prisoners, including you, were[/left]
released from the dungeons. You and only you were bathed,[/left]
dressed in fine clothing, and presented to the Emperor[/left]
himself. Emperor Uriel told you that the young man whose[/left]
life you saved at the carnival was his own son, the prince[/left]
%imp. The Emperor congratulated you on your[/left]
ability to charm, confuse, and befuddle and gave you[/left]
%q6 as a token of his appreciation.[/left]
He also asked you for a special favor.[/left]
[/end]"
4123,"You were born to a peasant family in a tiny village in[/left]
the %hpw of %hpn. Your parents and older[/left]
brothers were hard workers, proud of their strength and[/left]
endurance. The only thing big about you was your appetite.[/left]
You were of an inquisitive nature. No cupboard, closet, or[/left]
drawer was safe from your prying eyes and fingers. You[/left]
left no traces, but still your father and brothers beat[/left]
you when they caught you. By the time you were eleven,[/left]
they no longer caught you. Your mother taught you[/left]
%q1 and %q2, but you had no other[/left]
schooling and wanted none.[/left]
[/left]
Once, you climbed the wall of the local %q3[/left]
and spied on the young %q3a at practice. When[/left]
their equipment was left lying about you took it for your[/left]
own. In this way, you acquired a %q3b.[/left]
You also adopted a jacket shed by its owner and wore it[/left]
proudly about the village.[/left]
[/left]
One day, you saw some village boys hurling stones and[/left]
insults at an old woman named %fn.[/left]
Moved by an impulse you did not understand, you flung[/left]
rocks back at the boys. They laughed, but as you drew[/left]
near, they turned and ran away. You went back to[/left]
%fn and offered to see her to her door.[/left]
[/left]
""Come inside,"" %fn said. ""I have[/left]
something for you."" Her cottage was just one room, with[/left]
cats and kittens everywhere. ""Sit down,"" she said,[/left]
removing two cats from a stool. ""I'm going to teach you[/left]
about %q4.""[/left]
[/left]
""Why?"" you asked.[/left]
[/left]
""The cats don't need training in %q4,""[/left]
%fn said. ""You do. Or will. No matter.""[/left]
[/left]
Thus your training began. Her hands could no longer[/left]
perform, but her mind was still efficacious. You and[/left]
%fn became friends, as well as[/left]
student and teacher.[/left]
[/left]
On your sixteenth birthday, she told you that you must[/left]
leave. Your little village was too small for someone of[/left]
your talents.[/left]
[/left]
""What of you?"" you asked.[/left]
[/left]
""I also must move on. Perhaps some day you will visit me[/left]
in the Iliac Bay? I would like that. Until then, I have[/left]
my memories and my cats.""[/left]
[/left]
On your way to the Imperial City, you stopped in an inn[/left]
and heard that the Emperor was to pass the next day.[/left]
Instead of sneaking into a room, you spent the night in[/left]
a tree beside the road. You wanted to see the Emperor,[/left]
later there would always be chances to[/left]
%q12.[/left]
[/left]
The procession was very splendid indeed, but a nearby[/left]
rustle drew your attention. A black clad man was[/left]
crouching on a limb ten feet beneath you. You gasped[/left]
before you could stop yourself, and he twisted around,[/left]
bringing his bow to bear on you. With no time to draw a[/left]
weapon, you flung yourself at him, and together you[/left]
crashed down on the heads below, just as the Emperor's[/left]
carriage drew abreast.[/left]
[/left]
Hands seized you roughly. You felt dizzy and a trail[/left]
of fire burned along your left arm. Poison! Then a white[/left]
robed elf muttered an incantation over you. Your arm[/left]
cooled and your head cleared. The Emperor himself thanked[/left]
you and gave you %q5.[/left]
[/left]
The local folk treated you to drinks and food and[/left]
unaccustomed praise. Later you slipped away and found[/left]
that in addition to %q5,[/left]
the Emperor had handed you a note inviting you to share an[/left]
audience with him at the Imperial Palace. You set out[/left]
immediately.[/left]

You only know that your skills and your philosophy are what[/left]
kept you alive and sane during the dark years when Jagar Tharn[/left]

dissidents and other undesirables. Those they found[/left]
disappeared forever.[/left]
[/left]
For the benefit of all, an uneasy alliance formed between you[/left]
and all the other villagers who were in questionable lines of[/left]
work. One night, you witnessed a ragged boy being pursued by[/left]
a dozen blackclad agents of Jagar Tharn. You took a shortcut[/left]
through the alleys to meet the boy, and it took little effort[/left]
to convince him to run with you. The two of you stole into a[/left]
concealed cellar and waited for the agents to pass. The boy[/left]
was obviously not from the village, and when you asked him[/left]
his name, he told you, hesitantly, ""%imp.""[/left]

he was telling the truth. You told him the best way out of the[/left]

you that in reward for your service to Prince %imp,[/left]

4126,"You might not ever have been a thief, for you had been[/left]
raised and trained from an early age to be %q1.[/left]
Until the fateful day when the caravan your master,[/left]
%mn, and you were travelling in[/left]
was waylaid by a orc tribe, you were content that your place in[/left]
life was set. Suddenly, everything you believed in was proved[/left]
false. The treacherous %q1a you had put[/left]
your faith in sacrificed you in order that he might escape the[/left]
orcs. Though you managed to survive in your new role as a[/left]
captive of the orcs, you never again would trust[/left]
%q1.[/left]
[/left]
You had grown up among the superstitious people in the backwater[/left]
%hpw of %hpn, and had believed that orcs[/left]
were demons or Daedra, but you found the tribe to be surprisingly[/left]
civil. They needed a %ra to interpret the books they[/left]
had found about the ancient Orcish capital of Orsinium. As you[/left]
stayed with them and learned their language, you developed a[/left]
respect for their primitive but noble ambitions. Nevertheless,[/left]
you knew that you needed the society of other %ra[/left]
people, so when the opportunity rose, you escaped.[/left]
[/left]
Times were difficult all over %hpn, but you found[/left]
that the %q2 and %q3 skills you had[/left]
developed in the orc camp allowed you to be a fairly successful[/left]
thief. One night, while ransacking a nobleman's townhouse, you[/left]
came across correspondence between him and the former Imperial[/left]
Battlemage Jagar Tharn. You sold these to a contact you had in[/left]
town for more gold than you anticipated they would be worth.[/left]

visit from Prince %imp in your room at the tavern.[/left]

his father for the past ten years, and only recently had the[/left]
true Emperor been restored. Loyal subjects like you were rare[/left]

4128,"You have vague memories of living in a city with a young[/left]
woman and man, but for most of your childhood you lived in[/left]
a small home on the edge of a densely forested area. There[/left]
the elderly man that you called ""grandfather"" performed his[/left]
duties as the unofficial warden of the forest, and also[/left]
sheriff of the nearby area. Your supposed grandfather was[/left]
really much too old for that to be his true relationship to[/left]
you, but he did care for you with a tenderness that was at[/left]
odds with his otherwise gruff exterior. Your early years are[/left]
recalled as an endless stream of days spent out of doors,[/left]
wearing only loose clothing or the simple robe that your[/left]
grandfather favored. He taught you about %q1[/left]
and how to %q3 and %q9. And[/left]
when there were no warding duties for him to perform, there[/left]
was always weapons practice; your grandfather had mastered[/left]
an incredible variety of weaponry, and insisted that you[/left]
become familiar with each one. He was often required to deal[/left]
with some forest predator that had been causing local[/left]
problems, or with bands of brigands passing through the area,[/left]
and you were proud whenever you were able to help.[/left]
[/left]
It was just such an outlaw band that caused the combat wound[/left]
that was ultimately fatal to your grandfather. You and he were[/left]
able to return to his home, and at first he tried to act as if[/left]
this were just another scratch, to be allowed to naturally[/left]
heal. But finally even he faced the inevitability of his age[/left]
and accumulated injuries, and he gave you careful instructions[/left]
concerning the disposition of his possessions. He also told[/left]
you to go to a temple being run by an old friend of his, to[/left]
continue your growth and sustain your %q1 training[/left]
and allow you to continue %q3a.[/left]
A few days later, your grandfather died with the quiet dignity[/left]
that he had always displayed. You were distraught at the loss[/left]
of the only friend and family that you had ever had, but you[/left]
packed your few belongings and travelled to the temple,[/left]
honoring your grandfather's request.[/left]
[/left]
%fn, the chief priestess of the temple[/left]
was an older woman, but she was much younger than your[/left]
grandfather had been. You shared your sorrow with her for[/left]
your recent loss. Then you agreed with her that, besides[/left]
general training in %q1 and similar[/left]
studies, you would ignore the set of courses dealing with[/left]
armor and shields. To pay for your training, you used your[/left]
forestry skills to provide a regular supply of fresh meat[/left]
for the temple's larder.[/left]
[/left]
Some years later, on a day that seemed like any other, you had[/left]
just returned from collecting game for the food supply when the[/left]
chief priestess came to see you. She told you that she received[/left]
a message that an Imperial coach was ambushed at a location[/left]
close to the temple, and that important people and material[/left]
needed to be recovered. You allowed yourself an hour to perform[/left]
your grandfather's favorite meditation exercises, and left on[/left]
this new mission both refreshed and with some insight[/left]
concerning where to search for the robbers. Your meditations[/left]
bore fruit at dusk, as you stealthily approached an encampment[/left]
approximately where you had expected it to be. Throughout[/left]
the night you gradually stalked and subdued the camp guard, but[/left]
then you had to kill all of the other outlaws because they[/left]
resisted capture. You were abashed to return to the temple[/left]
shortly after breakfast with only one captive, a maidservant,[/left]
and a mundane chest of government documents.[/left]
[/left]
However, when the Imperial representative arrived to claim[/left]
your results, she sought you out to congratulate you on a most[/left]
successful mission. Although you never knew for certain whether[/left]
the maidservant or some of the documents somehow had importance,[/left]
you were not surprised when you later received a most[/left]
interesting letter from the Imperial Palace, simply inviting[/left]
you to the palace on urgent business. You left the temple[/left]
immediately for the Imperial City.[/left]
[/end]"
4129,"When you were three or four, you became lost from your[/left]
parents for several days. You do not remember much about[/left]
that time lost in the %hpw except that a group[/left]
of strange creatures rescued you from a band of[/left]
%q5. When you finally made it back[/left]
to your parents' house, you described your rescuers,[/left]
and were told they were %q6.[/left]
Even today, you remember some words of their language.[/left]
[/left]
When you were of age, you joined the local militia to see[/left]
more of the world. You excelled at the training the[/left]
militia gave you in archery. There seemed to be no[/left]
limit to the distance you could shoot an arrow, and[/left]
you were often used by your masters as the model for[/left]
less adept students. In a few years time, you became[/left]
a master yourself.[/left]
[/left]
The shot that changed your fortune, however, was a bad[/left]
shot. You missed the tree you were aiming for and struck[/left]
the branches of a tree across the road, frightening a[/left]
concealed assassin who was waiting for the caravan of[/left]
Prince %imp, son of the Emperor. The[/left]
assassin was brought to the authorities, and the head[/left]
of the militia, desirous of imperial reward, told the[/left]
story of your misaimed arrow as if it were an expert[/left]
shot from a loyal subject. You soon found yourself[/left]
invited to court, as a member of the Imperial Guard.[/left]
[/left]
In the court of the Emperor, you continued to practice[/left]
your archery and, in addition, learned many new techniques[/left]
from the daily %q1 practice. To stay motivated,[/left]
%q2[/left]
and that gave you strength for the endless hours of work[/left]
and the weariness of weapon drills.[/left]
[/left]
You were overjoyed when you received word that the Emperor[/left]
had a quest for you, one that required the utmost tact[/left]
and unswerving loyalty. When you came to the palace that[/left]
night, you were surprised to find that the Emperor was[/left]
not surrounded by his usual large retinue, merely his[/left]
chief advisor, the Imperial Battlemage Ocato. There you[/left]
were told of the affair of Daggerfall.[/left]
[/end]"
4130,"You spent most of your childhood roaming the %hpw with[/left]
your mother, and she is the one who piqued your fascination[/left]
with %q9 through her tales and[/left]
legends about them. She even knew some words of their[/left]
language which she taught to you. You vowed to find one,[/left]
and so you applied yourself diligently to your mother's[/left]
lessons about the ways of the %hpw and its[/left]
many inhabitants. Later, your merchant father took you to[/left]
his offices and familiarized you with his work, but no[/left]
interest in this ever really developed. You did benefit[/left]
from the stable home that your parents provided, and your[/left]
father lovingly provided the gold pieces that were[/left]
required to broaden your %q1[/left]
training. Your greatest joy was always to head into the[/left]
%hpw, be it for a few hours or a week, packing only some food[/left]
and your %q1a. You wandered the %hpw[/left]
paths and amusing yourself by pursuing your childhood fantasy[/left]
to detect and track one of those remarkable creatures.[/left]
[/left]
It was around the time that you had completed almost all of[/left]
your %q1 courses that you first noticed a set of[/left]
tracks of a type that you had never seen previously. They[/left]
seemed both to begin and end out of nowhere. About two weeks[/left]
later, you spotted some bent branches that led you to a[/left]
different set of unknown prints that began and ended as the[/left]
previous set had. The next morning you reviewed your mental[/left]
picture of the patterns of tracks, and quartered in towards[/left]
their apparent source.[/left]
[/left]
Suddenly a nightmare of hair, teeth and claws leapt out[/left]
of the bushes about ten feet in front of you. You scrambled[/left]
up a tree, and heard the wild man right behind you, grunting[/left]
with glee. As you climbed higher, you heard a branch break[/left]
under you and turned to see the man land hard on the ground.[/left]
Recognizing the opportunity, you leapt down beside him and[/left]
%q1b.[/left]
[/left]
You investigated the bushes where he had come from, and[/left]
discovered a cave where the cannibal had kept the bones of[/left]
several less fortunate rangers. You also found a ragged young[/left]
boy in chains, evidently the meal you interrupted. After[/left]
you freed him, he told you his name was %imp,[/left]
and he was a son of the Emperor Uriel Septim. Something[/left]
about him made you believe him, even when he told you that[/left]
his father's counselor Jagar Tharn has usurped his throne,[/left]
and forced %imp and his brothers into hiding.[/left]
[/left]
You gave the lad the gold in your purse and wished him good[/left]
luck, and you never told anyone about the incident with the[/left]
cannibal in the %hpw. Some months later,[/left]
however, your family was mystified when you received a[/left]
package from the Emperor himself, inviting you to the[/left]
Imperial City so you might receive your reward.[/left]
[/end]"
4131,"When you were very young, your parents joined a group that[/left]
was moving to the outskirts of the civilized area of[/left]
%hpn to start a new village in the %hpw.[/left]
Your childhood was spent helping to do the mundane and[/left]
grueling work required by this sort of venture. The[/left]
physical hardiness inherited from your parents helped[/left]
considerably in this regard, and you developed physically[/left]
at an early age. You also showed some skill at[/left]
%q1, and spent time with an elder of[/left]
the village who had you practice %q3.[/left]
[/left]
Your prowess grew as your warrior skills developed,[/left]
supported by a ready grasp of %q1.[/left]
Unfortunately, you eventually found that you had reached[/left]
the limit of what you could learn in the %hpw,[/left]
so one day you reluctantly approached your parents. After[/left]
much discussion and resistance, they grudgingly supported[/left]
your request to travel to a fighting school to continue[/left]
your training, cautioning you that you would have to[/left]
support yourself during this time. Although saddened[/left]
to separate from your parents and siblings, you were[/left]
excited at the prospect of seeing some of the fabled[/left]
civilization of Tamriel.[/left]
[/left]
While at the fighting school, you worked after hours at[/left]
various odd jobs. These included guard assignments and[/left]
bouncer duty at a local inn, both of which additionally[/left]
provided opportunities for you to polish your skills.[/left]
You also became friends with an classmate named[/left]
%fn. When %fn completed[/left]
the training, you vowed to make regular visits to the[/left]
Imperial City. However, your first trip to the Imperial[/left]
City also included your first exposure to the distaste[/left]
that some of the inhabitants and members of the court[/left]
express toward someone of your physical presence and[/left]
comparatively coarse manners. Your only compensation[/left]
for this was the ready friendship shown by many of the[/left]
Imperial Guard.[/left]
[/left]
On your third visit to the Imperial City, you were[/left]
looking for %fn when one of[/left]
the Guard told you that a small group of mercenaries,[/left]
including %fn, had been attacked[/left]
and captured by suspected supporters of the former[/left]
Imperial usurper, Jagar Tharn. Without waiting for[/left]
reinforcements, you set off immediately. When you[/left]
finally found the rebel encampment you hesitated because[/left]
of the size of the outlaw band. You did not procrastinate[/left]
for long. You used the natural cover of the woodland to[/left]
your advantage and, one by one, you stalked your target[/left]
and %q1a. Luckily, just[/left]
when even you were beginning to tire, some of the[/left]
captives, led by %fn, escaped their[/left]
bonds and helped to finish off the remainder of the band.[/left]
[/left]
Your group made its way back to the Imperial City, where[/left]
you also enjoyed the congratulations of many of the Guard.[/left]
And then shortly thereafter, you received a message from[/left]
the Emperor himself.[/left]
[/end]"
4132,"Your earliest memories are of being hungry, cold and[/left]
alone. You never were able to find out who your parents[/left]
were, or how you came to be left to survive by yourself[/left]
in the city streets. You can recall only a few mental[/left]
scenes from your childhood. One of the more vivid ones[/left]
were finding %q10 on a corpse in[/left]
an alley. Much of your childhood was a daily struggle[/left]
simply to stay alive, and retain your few possessions,[/left]
and you can remember distinctly the time when[/left]
%q2.[/left]
As you got older, only a few people were able to[/left]
penetrate the shell that was forming around your[/left]
friendlier inclinations. The most significant of them[/left]
was %fn, who had just been accepted[/left]
to the city guards. At first, %fn[/left]
would bring you food and provide some weapons practice[/left]
and advice for you, but eventually she sponsored your[/left]
petition for acceptance to a novice warriors' school,[/left]
and provided a portion of the gold required as payment.[/left]
Then, after your training was complete, she was able to[/left]
get you a job as a guard for one of the many merchants'[/left]
caravans that criss-crossed Tamriel's roads and[/left]
provinces.[/left]
[/left]
Over the next two years, you rented yourself to a[/left]
succession of these caravans, learning much of Tamriel[/left]
and its inhabitants. You also polished your[/left]
%q1 skills with some actual fighting[/left]
experiences in the rougher and more unsettled portions[/left]
of the continent. You found it easy to transfer your[/left]
early self-defensive inclinations to the caravan as a[/left]
whole. Finally though, you decided to return to your[/left]
home city and seek out your friend %fn.[/left]
You discovered, however, that she had likewise[/left]
progressed quickly, and had been invited to the Imperial[/left]
City to join a troop of the Imperial Guards. The trip[/left]
to the capital drained your funds, so you immediately[/left]
took a job there, working evenings at maintaining order[/left]
in one of the rowdier inns.[/left]
[/left]
You made friends with all the regulars in the inn, but[/left]
your sympathy was won by a nervous, mute boy who kept[/left]
the bar stocked. He seemed so frightened and alone that[/left]
he reminded you of your own lonely childhood. When one[/left]
of the drunken regulars stuck the boy, you leapt to his[/left]
defense. The boy looked at you with such gratitude that[/left]
your heart almost broke. Then, a few days later, he[/left]
disappeared.[/left]
[/left]
Months later, while you were helping restock the cellar,[/left]
you were called to the front door, and there was the boy[/left]
again. This time he was dressed in Imperial robes and[/left]
surrounded by escorts including %fn.[/left]
The ""mute"" boy spoke in an unmistakably aristocratic[/left]
voice, ""My name is Prince %imp, son of the[/left]
true Emperor of Tamriel, Uriel Septim VII. When I was[/left]
in hiding, fleeing from the wrath of the usurper Jagar[/left]
Tharn, you befriended me and saved my life. Please[/left]
accept the greatest gift the Emperor can bestow, his[/left]
gratitude.""[/left]
[/left]
He also presented you with a summons from the Emperor[/left]
himself, who apparently had need of a champion such as[/left]
you. Perhaps your luck was finally beginning to change.[/left]
[/end]"
4133,"Your earliest memories are of the blazing fire in the[/left]
furnace and the smell of heated metal. Your father was a[/left]
blacksmith of great renown. People from all over the[/left]
province of %hpn would come seeking his[/left]
services. As soon as you were able, you learned to help[/left]
him in the smithy. He taught you how to repair bent metal[/left]
and to keep a blade's edge sharp.[/left]
[/left]
When you were of age, you joined the local militia to see[/left]
more of the world. You excelled at the training the[/left]
militia gave you in %q1. Your knowledge[/left]
of weapon repair made you invaluable to the underfunded[/left]
militia. One day a visitor in full plate armor arrived at[/left]
the barracks. Introductions were made through the[/left]
Constable and thus you met Sir %mn. The[/left]
knight escorted you outside and %q1a.[/left]
Without a word, he brought up his mace from his belt and[/left]
levelled a blow at your head. Startled, you barely[/left]
deflected the blow. After several more blows which you[/left]
managed to avoid, the knight smiled. That was your[/left]
test. You became Sir %mn's squire[/left]
and you moved to the Imperial City.[/left]
[/left]
In the court of the Emperor, you learned many[/left]
techniques from the daily %q1 practice. To stay motivated,[/left]
%q2[/left]
and that gave you strength for the endless hours of work[/left]
and the weariness of weapon drills.[/left]
[/left]
One evening you were reading an old manuscript by a[/left]
great %q1 master, a shadow in the hall drew[/left]
your attention. Suspecting some of your fellow squires of[/left]
playing at practical jokes, you grabbed your wooden[/left]
practice sword and eased into the hall. Sneaking up behind[/left]
the shadow, you easily got close enough to push the sword[/left]
into the shadow's back.[/left]
[/left]
Despite all your training, you could not help but stop,[/left]
stunned, when the shadow hissed at you and turned, revealing[/left]
itself to be a cloaked goblin, dagger in hand. With hardly[/left]
time for a thought, your instincts took over and the[/left]
wooden sword in your hand swung out and knocked[/left]
the goblin cold. Still shaking, you called for the[/left]
guard.[/left]
[/left]
In the morning you were summoned before the Emperor.[/left]
Dressed in borrowed armor, not quite the right size you[/left]
walked into the throne room, dwarfed by its size. Bowing[/left]
before the Emperor you took the oath of knighthood and[/left]
were received into the ranks of Heraldry. It was not two[/left]
days from then that you received word that the Emperor[/left]
had a quest for you, one that required the utmost tact[/left]
and unswerving loyalty. When you came to the palace that[/left]
night, you were surprised to find that the Emperor was[/left]
not surrounded by his usual large retinue, merely his[/left]
chief advisor, the Imperial Battlemage Ocato. There you[/left]
were told of the affair of Daggerfall.[/end]"
4134,"Ria Silmane was a powerful enchantress, one of the Elders[/left]
of the Imperial Council, and a worthy successor to the[/left]
Imperial Battlemage when Jagar Tharn elected to retire.[/left]
She was also a friend of yours, your first tutor in the[/left]
Imperial City. When she disappeared, you were the first[/left]
person to notice and begin an investigation. You must[/left]
have been getting close, for you were ambushed by agents[/left]
of the Emperor and thrown into a cell deep within the[/left]
sewers, with no food or water. It was there that Ria[/left]
Silmane found you.[/left]
[/left]
Ria appeared to you as a spectre, for she too had been[/left]
betrayed by the man who now, with the ultimate gall,[/left]
dared to impersonate the Emperor: Jagar Tharn, her former[/left]
master. The true Emperor was imprisoned by Tharn's magic.[/left]
Only you would be able to find the flaw in Jagar Tharn's[/left]
spell, free the Emperor, and expose the traitorous[/left]
Battlemage.[/left]
[/left]
With Ria's help, you escaped from your cell, and under her[/left]
direction, you began the quest for the Staff of Chaos.[/left]
Tharn had used the Staff to imprison the true Emperor and[/left]
had then broken it, scattering it in secure locations[/left]
throughout the Empire. Nearly ten years passed while Tharn[/left]
consolidated his power and Ria's spectral form slowly[/left]
dissolved, but at last you found all the pieces of the[/left]
Staff of Chaos and combined them to form the key to the[/left]
prison of the true Emperor. The final piece of the staff[/left]
was a gem hidden in the Imperial Palace itself.[/left]
[/left]
Jagar Tharn had surrounded himself with a host of guards,[/left]
human and otherwise. When you at last reached the gem, you[/left]
discovered why they had fought so furiously. The gem not[/left]
only freed the Emperor, but it destroyed Tharn, for the[/left]
Imperial Battlemage had used his own lifeforce to empower[/left]
the Staff.[/left]
[/left]
When the true Emperor once again assumed the throne, he[/left]
considered himself greatly in your debt. You were often[/left]
called upon to investigate evidence of Tharn's aborted[/left]
master plan, and though you discovered little of great[/left]
relevance, you were well rewarded. Still, you were not[/left]
often at court. The Emperor almost considered you a rare[/left]
and valued weapon, to be drawn only away from others'[/left]
eyes.[/left]
[/left]
When the Emperor told you of the haunting of King[/left]
Lysandus, your instinct told you that the Emperor was[/left]
not telling you the entire story. Nevertheless, even[/left]
if he did consider you a friend, the Emperor's word was[/left]
law, and you boarded a ship that very night for[/left]
Daggerfall.[/left]

don't need to tell you that summoning a Daedra[/center]

consideration. If the need, in your opinion,[/center]
merits a summoning, the Guild Summoner will[/center]
aid you. Naturally, Daedra lords may only be[/center]
summoned on certain particular days for the[/center]
safety of the Guild as a whole. It is a grave[/center]
privilege, %pcn, of which[/center]
the Guild finds you worthy.[/center]

upon you the rank of %lev. By[/center]

recognizes. As a full %lev,[/center]
you may call upon the services of the Travellers[/center]
League, who guard the Guild's most treasured and[/center]
secret room -- the Teleportation Chamber.[/center]
From there, you may travel to any other [/center]
settlement in the Bay in but a twinkling.[/center]
As your time is most valuable, the[/center]
Chamber should aid you. Once again,[/center]
permit me to congratulate you on[/center]
this great honor, %lev.[/center]

6600,"Congratulations, %pcn. For[/center]
all your efforts toward the greater glory of[/center]
%god, we have raised you to the[/center]
rank of %lev. With this change[/center]
in title, you are also gaining access to our[/center]
cauldron, where our chemists devise potions[/center]
for our temple. You need no longer travel[/center]
to the Mages Guild in order to purchase[/center]
necessary potions.[/center]
[/end]"
6601,"You have doubtlessly heard something of[/center]
our famous libraries. Now you will have[/center]
access to them, for the archpriests have[/center]
found you worthy of an elevation in rank.[/center]
Henceforth, you are a %lev,[/center]
and the libraries are yours to explore.[/center]
Congratulations, %pcf.[/center]
[/end]"
6602,"Your loyalty and skill have not gone[/center]
unnoticed, %pcf. In fact, it is my[/center]
honor to inform you that the temple elders[/center]
have decided to give you a new title, that[/center]
of %lev. But it is more than[/center]
a title. With it, you have a new privilege[/center]
in the temple -- the right to use our[/center]
Potionmaker. Talk to our mixer if you[/center]
don't believe me. Congratulations.[/center]
[/end]"
6603,"Our temple is not without its secrets,[/center]
some of them very dark indeed. Now you[/center]
have demonstrated trustworthiness enough[/center]
that the elders have promoted you to the[/center]
next rank, %lev. If you[/center]
wish, %lev %pcn, you[/center]
may indulge in the buying and selling of[/center]
soulgems. It's a controversial practice,[/center]
but soulgems may be used by enchanters[/center]
to create unique magical items. I would[/center]
talk to our soul procurer for more[/center]
details. Whether you choose to involve[/center]
yourself or not, of course, is your[/center]
decision. Whatever you decide, I want[/center]
to wish you congratulations[/center]
on your new title.[/center]
[/end]"
6604,"You are no neonate anymore, %pcf.[/center]
The council has elected to promote you to[/center]
the title of %lev, a very[/center]
honored position in the temple. As such[/center]
you are given a terrible privilege -- the[/center]
right to summon Daedra. Obviously, the[/center]
theological implications alone should give[/center]
pause, but if, in your wisdom, you decide[/center]
to summon a Prince of Oblivion, we will[/center]
aid you in your endeavor. The Summoner[/center]
will obviously be able to tell you more.[/center]
Whatever you decide to do will be wise.[/center]
After all, you're a %lev now.[/center]
[/end]"
6605,"Congratulations, %pcf. The[/center]
council has chosen to honor you once[/center]
again with a promotion in rank. Your[/center]
loyalty and your talent has won you no[/center]
small esteem here, and earned you your[/center]
new title, %lev. From[/center]
this moment on, if ever you need a wound[/center]
healed, talk to me or one of the other[/center]
clerics. We'll be happy to do what we[/center]
can for you for free. Once again,[/center]
my congratulations. You've[/center]
earned it.[/center]
[/end]"
6606,"Ah, congratulations, %pcf, or[/center]
shall I now call you, %lev? The[/center]
council has nearly unanimously voted to[/center]
promote you within the temple, my friend.[/center]
The best news of it is that this is no[/center]
empty title of respect. You now have[/center]
access to the spellbooks of the temple.[/center]
You can talk to our scribe and purchase[/center]
spells without the bother of going all[/center]
the way to the Mages Guild. You're[/center]
rising far, I can see.[/center]
[/end]"
6607,"Good day to you, %lev. Or hadn't[/center]
you heard that the council just today voted[/center]
you a new rank in the temple? And not just[/center]
any title either, my friend, but the rank[/center]
by which you have the right to use temple's[/center]
Spellmaker. It's a terribly complicated,[/center]
but terribly useful apparatus. If you[/center]
haven't used it before at, say, the Mages[/center]
Guild, you really ought to. Now that you're[/center]
a %lev and able.[/center]
[/end]"
6608,"Allow me to offer you my most sincere[/center]
and heartfelt congratulations. The council,[/center]
by an appreciable majority, has decided that[/center]
you will henceforth be addressed by a new[/center]
title: %lev. If that weren't[/center]
grand enough, the practical side is that you[/center]
can now rummage through the temple's hordish[/center]
supply of esoteria, instruments, ballyhock,[/center]
and phantasmagoria -- all for sale at very[/center]
reasonable prices. Go on, ask the magical[/center]
archivist ... %lev.[/center]
[/end]"
6609,"It is, I understand, quite official. Effective[/center]
immediately, you are elevated in rank, and most[/center]
importantly, in privilege, by order of the[/center]
elder clerics, to %lev. What[/center]
this means, in practical terms, is not only[/center]
more respect, but access to one of the temple's[/center]
most valuable people, the enchanter. The[/center]
enchanter can help you make the most mundane[/center]
object you own into a force of supernal power.[/center]
It's somewhat more complicated than that, but[/center]
nevertheless, an honor indeed. I congratulate[/center]
you on your upward spiral.[/center]
[/end]"
6610,"A most, ah, perspicacious judgment, my child.[/center]
Now then, your inceptive title will be that of[/center]
%lev, but I wouldn't fret about[/center]
rank. The important part is that you now have[/center]
access to the temple's superlative libraries[/center]
and trainers. Be patient and you will see the[/center]
fruit of your labor. Learn, %lev.[/center]
Read and learn.[/center]
[/end]"
6611,"It would appear that the Dark Brotherhood was[/center]
wise in recruiting such of you. Our confidence[/center]
in you has grown, and it is only right to give[/center]
you an increase in rank within the Brotherhood.[/center]
Consider yourself starting today a full-fledged[/center]
%lev. Our chemists have been[/center]
instructed that you are permitted to buy[/center]
potions and poisons from their wares, so you[/center]
needn't visit the Mages Guild any longer. I[/center]
would also like to give you the location of[/center]
another graveyard you ought really to be[/center]
acquainted, %dng.[/center]
Here it is, on your map. Once again, my[/center]
congratulations, %lev.[/center]
[/end]"
6612,"So far, you have proven yourself to be more[/center]
than a common thug, %pcf. We[/center]
have decided to promote you within the Dark[/center]
Brotherhood. Beginning today your rank is[/center]
%lev. Now, in addition to[/center]
the regular training we provide, you have[/center]
access to our cauldron. There are a number[/center]
of very clever poisons that have come from[/center]
that tub. Finally, let me give you the[/center]
location of another graveyard you may find[/center]
interesting, %dng.[/center]
I'll mark it on your map. Congratulations,[/center]
%lev. So far, so bad.[/center]
[/end]"
6613,"I think it's about time you received an[/center]
increase in rank to match your value to the[/center]
Dark Brotherhood. Others agree with me, so[/center]
you may now assume the illustrious mantle of[/center]
%lev of the Dark Brotherhood.[/center]
As a %lev, you are permitted[/center]
to deal in soulgems with our soul procurer.[/center]
It's a nice method to add more profit to[/center]
punishment -- the souls of your victims can[/center]
fetch a decent price among those who want a[/center]
spirit to bind in enchantment rites. Of[/center]
course, you can buy soulgems from the[/center]
procurer as well as sell them. I also[/center]
wanted to show you a new graveyard in[/center]
%reg, %dng.[/center]
I think you will find it very interesting[/center]
indeed, %lev.[/center]
[/end]"
6614,"%pcf, you have a callous disregard for[/center]
human life, a disgusting nonchalance about[/center]
accepting gold for murder. We couldn't be more[/center]
delighted with you. The Brotherhood has chosen[/center]
to once again promote you in our ranks. You are[/center]
now %lev %pcn. It[/center]
is more than a title, though. It means that you[/center]
can now speak to our Spymaster, the character[/center]
who keeps us informed about the newest, most[/center]
important happenings in the Iliac Bay region.[/center]
I can give you a little rumor myself. There's[/center]
a cemetery called %dng,[/center]
with the most delightful treasures and[/center]
surprises. I know you'll love it. Here,[/center]
I'll mark it on your map, %pcf.[/center]
Or I should say, %lev %pcf.[/center]

8353,"The 15th of Morning Star is a holiday taken very[/center]
seriously in %cn, where they call[/center]
it South Wind's Prayer, a plea by all the religions[/center]
of Tamriel for a good planting season. Citizens with[/center]
every affliction known in Tamriel flock to services[/center]
in the %ct's temples, as the clergy is[/center]
known to perform free healings on this day. Only[/center]
a few will be judged worthy of this service, but[/center]
few can afford the temples usual price...[/center]
[/end]"
8354,"The Day of Lights is celebrated as a holy day by[/center]
most villages in Hammerfell on the Iliac Bay.[/center]
It is a prayer for a good farming and fishing[/center]
year, and is taken very seriously.[/center]
[/end]"
8355,"The people in Yeorth Burrowland invented Waking Day[/center]
in prehistoric times to wake the spirits of nature[/center]
after a long, cold winter. It has evolved into a[/center]
sort of orgiastic celebration of the end of winter.[/center]
[/end]"
8356,"Mad Pelagius is a silly little tradition in High[/center]
Rock in a mock memorial to Pelagius Septim II, one[/center]
of the maddest emperors in recent history. He died[/center]
about 350 years ago, so the Septims since have taken[/center]
it with good humor.[/center]

Othroktide, the day when Baron Othrok took Dwynnen[/center]

They celebrate it vigorously on the Day of Release.[/center]

8359,"Today is the 16th of Sun's Dawn, a holiday celebrated[/center]
all over Tamriel as Heart's Day. It seems that in every[/center]
house, the Legend of the Lovers is being sung for the[/center]
younger generation. In honor of these Lovers, Polydor[/center]

free room for visitors. If such kindness had been[/center]
given the Lovers, it is said, it would always be[/center]
springtime in the world.[/center]
[/end]"
8360,"Perserverance Day is quite a party in Ykalon. It was[/center]
originally held as a solemn memorial to those killed[/center]

since become a boisterous festival.[/center]
[/end]"
8361,"The villages in the Bantha celebrate the baser[/center]

of them are for the overly virtuous.[/center]
[/end]"
8362,"On the 7th of First Seed every year, the people of %cn[/center]
celebrate First Planting, symbolically sowing the seeds[/center]
for the autumn harvest. It is a festival of fresh[/center]
beginnings, both for the crops and for the men and[/center]
women of the %ct. Neighbors are reconciled[/center]
in their disputes, resolutions are formed, bad habits[/center]
dropped, the diseased cured. The clerics at the[/center]
temples run a free clinic all day long to cure[/center]
people of poisoning, different diseases, paralyzation,[/center]
and the other banes found in the world of Tamriel.[/center]

8363,"The Day of Waiting is a very old holy day among[/center]

everyone locks himself up inside.[/center]
[/end]"
8364,"Flower Day is another of the frivolous celebrations[/center]

8365,"During the Festival of Blades, the people of the[/center]

very popular in the desert.[/center]
[/end]"
8366,"On Gardtide, the people of Tamarilyn Point hold a[/center]
festival to honor Druagaa, the old goddess of[/center]
flowers. Worship of the goddess is all but dead,[/center]
but the celebration is always a great success.[/center]
[/end]"
8367,"The Day of the Dead is one of the more peculiar[/center]
holidays of Daggerfall. The superstitious say that[/center]
the dead rise on this holiday to wreak vengeance[/center]
on the living. It is a fact that King Lysandus'[/center]
spectre began its haunting on the Day of the[/center]
Dead, 3E 404.[/center]

8368,"All along the seaside of Hammerfell, no one leaves[/center]

[/end]"
8369,"Be warned that today is Jester's Day in the[/center]
%ct of %cn, and pranks are[/center]
being set up from one end of town to the other.[/center]
It is as if a spell has been cast over the[/center]
community, for even the most taciturn and[/center]
dignified councilman might attempt to play a[/center]
joke on his %t. The Thieves Guild[/center]
finds particular attention as everyone looks for[/center]
pickpockets in particular.[/center]
[/end]"
8370,"The celebration of Second Planting is in full glory[/center]
this day. It is a holiday with traditions similar to[/center]
First Planting, improvements on the first seeding[/center]
symbolically to suggest improvements on the soul.[/center]
The free clinics of the temples are open for the[/center]
second and last time this year, offering cures for[/center]
those suffering from any kind of disease or affliction.[/center]
Because peace and not conflict is stressed at this time,[/center]
battle injuries are healed only at full price.[/center]
[/end]"
8371,"Marukh's Day is only observed by certain communities[/center]

virtuous prophet Marukh, the people of Skeffington[/center]
Wood pray for the strength to resist temptation.[/center]

8372,"The Fire Festival in Northmoor is one of the most[/center]

ancient days and has become quite a festival.[/center]

[/end]"
8374,"The festival of Drigh R'Zimb, held in the hottest[/center]
time of year in Abibon-Gora, is a jubilation held[/center]

how long Drigh R'Zimb has been held, but it is[/center]
possible the Redguards brought the festival[/center]
with them when they came in the first era.[/center]
[/end]"
8375,"Today is the 16th of Mid Year, the traditional day[/center]
for the Mid Year Celebration. Perhaps to alleviate[/center]
the annual news of the Emperor's latest tax increase,[/center]
the %ct temples offer blessings for[/center]
only half the donation they usually suggest. Many so[/center]
blessed feel confident enough to enter the[/center]
%lp dungeons when they are not fully[/center]
prepared, so this joyous festival has often been[/center]
known to turn suddenly into a day of defeat and tragedy.[/center]
[/end]"
8376,"Dancing Day is a time-honored holiday in Daggerfall.[/center]
Who started it is questionable, but the Red Prince[/center]

the people of Daggerfall, from the nobles down.[/center]
[/end]"
8377,"Tibedetha is middle Tamrielic for ""Tibers Day.""[/center]
It is not surprising that the lorddom of Alcaire[/center]

8378,"The bargain shoppers of the known world are out in[/center]
force today and it is little wonder, for the 10th[/center]
of Sun's Height is a holiday called the Merchants'[/center]
Festival. Every marketplace and equipment store[/center]
has dropped their prices to at least half. The only[/center]
shop not being patronized today is the Mages Guild,[/center]
where prices are as exorbitant as usual. Most[/center]
citizens in need of a magical item are waiting two[/center]
months for the celebration of Tales and Tallows[/center]

8379,"During Divat Etep't, the people of Antiphyllos[/center]
mourn the death of the one of the greatest of the[/center]
early Redguard heroes, Divat, son of Frandar of[/center]

almost certainly genuine.[/center]

8380,"You will have to wait until tomorrow if you are[/center]
planning on making any equipment purchases, for[/center]
all stores are closed in observance of Sun's Rest.[/center]
Of course, the temples, taverns, and Mages Guild in[/center]
the %ct are still open their regular[/center]
hours, but most citizens chose to devote this day[/center]
to relaxation, not commerce or prayer. This is not[/center]
a convenient arrangement for all, but the[/center]
Merchants' Guild heavily fines any shop that stays[/center]
open, so everyone complies.[/center]
[/end]"
8381,"Few besides the natives of the Alik'r Desert[/center]

worthy of the graces of the gods.[/center]
[/record]
"
8384,"The Feast of the Tiger in the Bantha rainforest[/center]

celebration and festival from village to village.[/center]

8385,"Appreciation Day in Anticlere is an ancient[/center]
holiday of thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest[/center]

8386,"Perhaps no other festival fires the spirit of[/center]
%cn as much as the one held[/center]
today, Harvest's End. The work of the year is[/center]
over, the seeding, sowing, and reaping. Now is[/center]
the time to celebrate and enjoy the fruits of[/center]
the harvest, and even visitors to %reg are[/center]
invited to join the farmers. The taverns offer[/center]
free drinks all day long, an extravagance[/center]
before the economy of the coming winter months.[/center]
Underfed farm hands gorging themselves and then[/center]
getting sick in the town square are the most[/center]
common sights of the celebration of Harvest's End.[/center]

8387,"No other holiday divides the people of %cn like[/center]
the 3rd of Hearth Fire. A few of the oldest, more[/center]
superstitious men and women do not speak all day[/center]
long for fear that the evil spirits of the dead[/center]
will enter their bodies. Most citizens enjoy the[/center]
holiday, calling it Tales and Tallows, but even[/center]
the most lighthearted avoid the dark streets of[/center]
%cn, for everyone knows the dead[/center]
do walk tonight. Only the Mages Guild completely[/center]

oldest magical science, necromancy, all magical[/center]
items are half price today.[/center]

over a hundred years ago, and the holiday has[/center]
since become a celebration of youth.[/center]

8392,"Today is the 13th of Frostfall, known throughout[/center]
Tamriel as the Witches' Festival when the forces[/center]
of sorcery and religion clash. The Mages Guild gets[/center]
most of the business since weapons and items are[/center]
evaluated for their mystic potential free of charge[/center]
and magic spells are one half their usual price.[/center]
Demonologists, conjurors, lamias, warlocks, and[/center]
thaumaturgists meet in the wilderness outside %cn,[/center]

Goblin Chase on horseback. Recently, these[/center]

8398,"Today is the 20th of Sun's Dusk, the Warriors[/center]
Festival in %cn. Most all the[/center]
local warriors, spellswords, and rogues come[/center]
to the equipment stores and blacksmiths where[/center]
all weapons are half price. Unfortunately,[/center]
the low prices also tempt many an untrained[/center]
boy to buy his first sword and the normally[/center]

reverently observed by the temples as North[/center]
Wind's Prayer. It is a thanksgiving to the Gods[/center]

like this one, the harvest was not particularly[/center]
good and the winter unseasonally harsh in[/center]

9000.1,"1.   On a clear day you chance upon a strange animal, its[/left]
    leg trapped in a hunter's clawsnare. Judging from the[/left]
    bleeding it will not survive long. Do you:[/left]
 a) Draw your dagger, mercifully ending its life[/left]
    with a single thrust?[/left]
 b) Do not interfere in the natural evolution of events,[/left]
    but rather take the opportunity to learn more about[/left]
    a strange animal that you have never seen[/left]
    before?[/left]
 c) Use herbs from your pack to put it to sleep, then[/left]
    free it from the clawsnare and take it somewhere[/left]
    where it can be safe, knowing that in doing so you[/left]
    will probably deprive a hunter and his family of[/left]
    sustenance?[/left]"
9000.2,"2.   One summer afternoon your father gives you a choice[/left]
    of chores. Would you rather:[/left]
 a) Work in the forge with him casting iron for a new plow?[/left]
 b) Gather herbs for your mother who is preparing dinner?[/left]
 c) Go catch fish at the stream using a net and line?[/left]"
9000.3,"3.   Your father and you are returning from the town[/left]
    market when you see a small boy running from a store.[/left]
    In his hands he clutches a loaf of bread. Behind him[/left]
    races the baker with a cleaver in his hands. You know[/left]
    that the boy must be hungry, but the town is suffering[/left]
    from a drought, which has made food valuable. Do you:[/left]
 a) Side with justice and urge your father to stop the boy?[/left]
b) Help the poor waif by running into the baker's way?[/left]
 c) Stand out of the way and wait to see what your father[/left]
    decides, trusting his experience?[/left]"
9000.4,"4.   Your father tells you one night the story of his[/left]
    battle at Borim Valley, where his men had routed the[/left]
    enemy. They would have captured them all if not for the[/left]
    brave sacrifice of a young Sergeant on the opposing[/left]
    side, who held a pass long enough for his men to[/left]
    retreat to safety. He had done so knowing that it would[/left]
    cost him his life. If you had been that man would you[/left]
    have:[/left]
 a) Fled, rationalizing that your experience with battle[/left]
    tactics was too valuable to be wasted, and could make[/left]
    the difference later?[/left]
 b) Held the pass also, so that the men under your command[/left]
    could flee, though it meant your life?[/left]
 c) Searched for some means to distract the enemy so that[/left]
    your men might have the possibility of escaping, but[/left]
    not at the cost of your own life?[/left]"
9000.5,"5.   Your mother sends you to the market with a list of[/left]
    goods to buy. After you finish you find that by mistake[/left]
    a shopkeeper has given you too much money back in[/left]
    exchange for one of the items. Do you:[/left]
 a) Return to the store and give the shopkeeper his hard-[/left]
    earned money, explaining to him the mistake?[/left]
 b) Pocket the extra money, knowing that shopkeepers in[/left]
    general tend to overcharge customers anyway?[/left]
 c) Decide to put the extra money to good use and purchase[/left]
    items that would help your family?[/left]"
9000.6,"6.   While in a market place you witness a thief cut a[/left]
    purse from a noble. Even as he does so the noble[/left]
    notices and calls for the city guards. In his haste to[/left]
    get away, the thief drops the purse near you.[/left]
    Surprisingly, no one seems to notice the bag of coins[/left]
    at your feet. Do you: [/left]
 a) Pick up the bag and pocket it, knowing that the extra[/left]
    windfall will help your family in times of trouble?[/left]
 b) Pick up the bag and signal to the guard, knowing that[/left]
    the only honorable thing to do is return the money to[/left]
    its rightful owner?[/left]
 c) Leave the bag there, knowing that it is better not to[/left]
    get involved?[/left]"
9000.7,"7.   Your father sends you on a task which you loathe,[/left]
    cleaning the stables. On the way there, pitchfork in[/left]
    hand, you run into your friend from the homestead near[/left]
    your own. He offers to do it for you, in return for a[/left]
    future favor of his choosing. Do you:[/left]
 a) Decline his offer, knowing that your father expects you[/left]
    to do the work, and it is better not to be in debt?[/left]
 b) Accept his offer, reasoning that as long as the stables[/left]
    are cleaned, it matters not who does the cleaning?[/left]
 c) Ask him to help you, knowing that two people can do the[/left]
    job faster than one, and agree to help him with one[/left]
    task of his choosing in the future?[/left]"
9000.8,"8.   Your mother asks you to help fix the stove. While[/left]
     you are working, a very hot pipe slips its moorings[/left]
     and falls towards her. Do you:[/left]
 a) Push your mother out of the way?[/left]
b) Grab the hot pipe and try and push it away?[/left]
 c) Position yourself between the pipe and your mother?[/left]"
9000.9,"9.   While in town the baker gives you a sweetroll.[/left]
    Delighted, you take it into an alley to enjoy, only to[/left]
    be intercepted by a gang of three other kids your age.[/left]
    The leader demands the sweetroll, or else he and his[/left]
    friends will beat you and take it. Do you:[/left]
 a) Drop the sweetroll and step on it, then get ready for[/left]
    the fight?[/left]
 b) Give him the sweetroll now without argument, knowing[/left]
    that later this afternoon you will have all your[/left]
    friends with you and can come and take whatever he[/left]
    owes you?[/left]
 c) Act like you're going to give him the sweetroll but[/left]
    at the last minute throw it in the air, hoping that[/left]
    they'll pay attention to it long enough for you to get[/left]
    a shot in on the leader?[/left]"
9000.10,"10.    Entering town you find that you are witness to a[/left]
     very well dressed man running from a crowd. He screams[/left]
     to you for help. The crowd behind him seems very[/left]
     angry. Do you:[/left]
a)  Rush to the man's aid immediately, despite your lack[/left]
     of knowledge of the circumstances?[/left]
 b)  Rush to the town's aid immediately, despite your lack[/left]
     of knowledge of the circumstances?[/left]
 c)  Stand aside and allow the man and mob to pass,[/left]
     realizing that it is probably best not to get involved?[/left]"
9000.11,"11.    You and your best friend buy your first daggers[/left]
     together, a matched pair. You loan him the amount[/left]
     since he doesn't have enough gold, and he agrees to[/left]
     pay you back later. After leaving the shop you and he[/left]
     sit down to marvel at your new weapons. To your dismay[/left]
     you notice that there is a small notch on the blade[/left]
     of the dagger you selected. Your friend asks you to[/left]
     please watch his weapon for him while he runs an[/left]
     errand. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Wait for your friend's return then point out the flaw[/left]
     in your dagger and return to the weapons shop to[/left]
     demand a refund.[/left]
b)  Switch the daggers, rationalizing that since you paid[/left]
     for them you should get the first choice, and that if[/left]
     your friend ever notices the notch, you could always[/left]
     take him back to the weapon shop and get a refund?[/left]
 c)  Keep his dagger safe until his return, then switch the[/left]
     daggers with your best friend's knowledge, justifying[/left]
     it with the fact that you paid for them, and then[/left]
     offer to accompany him back to the weapons shop?[/left]"
9000.12,"12.    You are at weapons practice. Your Armsmaster is[/left]
     very old now, but takes his teaching very seriously.[/left]
     You have heard him say it is all he has left in life.[/left]
     Today he has ceaselessly taunted you at every mistake.[/left]
     Finally he asks you to attack him with the same[/left]
     technique you just did, in an effort to show you the[/left]
     proper execution. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Do the technique just fast enough so that he can block[/left]
     it, knowing that it is more important to allow the[/left]
     master to retain dignity, regardless of your personal[/left]
     feelings?[/left]
 b)  Attack him at full speed, knowing that you could[/left]
     probably score the hit and justify his unfair[/left]
     treatment of you by showing the class that you were[/left]
     actually doing it right?[/left]
c)  Refuse and leave practice, unable to compromise your[/left]
     anger with his dignity, and realizing that whatever[/left]
     course you choose would cause you to lose respect for[/left]
     either him or for yourself?[/left]"
9000.13,"13.    While throwing a ball to you your friend breaks a[/left]
     window on his house. His father rushes out and demands[/left]
     to know who broke the window. You know that your[/left]
     friend's father is a strict disciplinarian and will[/left]
     punish your friend severely if he takes the blame. You[/left]
     on the other hand, not being his son, could get away[/left]
     virtually unscathed. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Raise your hand and take the blame before your friend[/left]
     can answer?[/left]
b)  Remain silent and not get involved?[/left]
 c)  Point at your friend, knowing that anything else would[/left]
     probably delay the inevitable and make things just[/left]
     that much worse for him?[/left]"
9000.14,"14.    Your Armsmaster during a lesson on strategy[/left]
     remarks, 'The best victory is to completely and[/left]
     totally humiliate your opponent'. He then turns to you[/left]
     and asks you if you agree with him. You know the[/left]
     Armsmaster has been in numerous life and death[/left]
     conflicts and has the experience of a seasoned[/left]
     warrior. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Agree with his remark, knowing that at this moment[/left]
     your experience is not enough to justify any stance[/left]
     but total agreement with whatever your Armsmaster[/left]
     says, a man who has dedicated his life to strategy?[/left]
 b)  Disagree with his remark, reasoning that it must be[/left]
     some type of test, and that the truth will only come[/left]
     from opposition with his opinion, and not sheep-like[/left]
     agreement?[/left]
c)  Refuse to answer the question, choosing to withhold an[/left]
     opinion until you have more experience and can[/left]
     converse on the subject in an intelligent manner with[/left]
     him?[/left]"
9000.15,"15.    The senior student in your weapons class has[/left]
     trounced you unmercifully for the past several years.[/left]
     Today is the Tournament of Students and you find with[/left]
     dismay that you are paired against him for your first[/left]
     match. As you prepare your friend approaches and[/left]
     offers to tell you of an injury the senior student[/left]
     suffered in yesterday's sparring class, which you[/left]
     missed. Do you:[/left]
a)  Accept the offer, knowing that it would allow you to[/left]
     concentrate on the injured area and greatly increase[/left]
     your chances of beating him?[/left]
 b)  Refuse the offer, knowing that win or lose you would[/left]
     rather do it through your own skill and not some extra[/left]
     knowledge in what should be a fair and honorable[/left]
     fight?[/left]
 c)  Accept the offer, reasoning that it is better to have[/left]
     the knowledge in case you need it, and realizing that[/left]
     having the knowledge does not necessarily mean using[/left]
     it?[/left]"
9000.16,"16.    An old man stops you on the way to market,[/left]
     claiming to have been robbed. He is lying on the trail[/left]
     and seems gravely injured. He asks you to run to town[/left]
     and get the constable. You give him your word that you[/left]
     will go directly to town and bring the constable back.[/left]
     As you make your way back you notice a suspicious man[/left]
     creeping along another trail. He doesn't seem to[/left]
     notice you yet. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Follow the man, reasoning that if this man is the[/left]
     robber you could lead the constable directly to him[/left]
     and safeguard other travelers, although it would mean[/left]
     breaking your word?[/left]
 b)  Take note of him but continue on, reasoning that the[/left]
     man on the trail is hurt too badly to stop, regardless[/left]
     of any other consideration?[/left]
 c)  Take note of him but continue on, reasoning that your[/left]
     word is your bond and that it takes precedence over[/left]
     anything else?[/left]"
9000.17,"17.    While fishing one sunny afternoon you find that the[/left]
     boots which you discarded are now full of ants who are[/left]
     busily making their way from a piece of bread you[/left]
     dropped to their anthill. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Pick up the boots wash all the ants off now, even[/left]
     though you are not leaving until dusk?[/left]
 b)  Watch the ants, curious as to how they work so[/left]
     efficiently, and content to live and let live?[/left]
 c)  Make boats out of leaves and then send each ant down[/left]
     the stream to pass the time until a fish bites?[/left]"
9000.18,"18.    You hear the Armsmaster remark during weapons[/left]
     class, 'The intent of your opponent can be seen in his[/left]
     blade'. Many of the students scoff at this, though not[/left]
     openly. Do you:[/left]
a)  Feel that the disrespect the students show at this[/left]
     points to something which they do not understand, and[/left]
     therefore causes you to focus your efforts on[/left]
     understanding it all the more?[/left]
 b)  Feel that he means the way the opponent attacks and[/left]
     moves shows you how he feels?[/left]
 c)  Realize that Armsmaster Festil should not be the[/left]
     object of scorn, but rather one of respect, for he has[/left]
     lived a full life and survived things none of the[/left]
     students could imagine?[/left]"
9000.19,"19.    The town has a lottery in which the winning chit[/left]
     is called. You look in shock as the winning chit[/left]
     number matches your own! Before you can say anything[/left]
     another family walks forward. You have seen them before[/left]
     and know that they are extremely poor. Your family on[/left]
     the other hand could do without the 100 gold piece[/left]
     prize. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Say nothing and allow the other family to claim the[/left]
     prize?[/left]
 b)  Stand and show your chit, knowing that the prize is[/left]
     rightfully yours?[/left]
 c)  Stand and show your chit, and offer to split the prize[/left]
     in half with the other family?[/left]"
9000.20,"20.    Your Armsmaster poses a question one day to his[/left]
     class. A company of 100 men is attempting to flee from[/left]
     the enemy. There are two paths out of the broken[/left]
     stronghold. One path will kill half the men under the[/left]
     officers command, but the other half would survive. The[/left]
     other path has a fifty percent chance that everyone[/left]
     would die, but also a fifty percent chance that[/left]
     everyone would survive. As the commanding officer,[/left]
     would you:[/left]
a)  Choose the path that would guarantee half your men[/left]
     would survive?[/left]
b)  Choose the path that has a fifty percent chance that[/left]
     all would survive, and a fifty percent chance that all[/left]
     would perish?[/left]
c)  Turn the choice over to the men and let them decide by[/left]
     majority vote which path they should commit[/left]
     themselves to?[/left]"
9000.21,"21.    You have a great aunt and a great uncle living in[/left]
     two different nearby villages, both of whom have asked[/left]
     your father to allow you to live with them for a few[/left]
     weeks.[/left]
     Your father knows where he plans to send you, but he[/left]
     is curious about your opinion. Given the choice, would[/left]
     you rather:[/left]
 a)  Live with your great aunt -- a wise old woman of[/left]
     considerable wealth. Living in luxury for a few weeks[/left]
     could not only be enlightening, it could also be very[/left]
     interesting.[/left]
 b)  Live with your great uncle -- a sick old man who has[/left]
     always been something of a stranger to you. A few[/left]
     weeks with him may be ardorous, but he is in more need[/left]
     of your help than your great aunt.[/left]
 c)  Think of a way to divide your time between your great[/left]
     aunt and great uncle. Perhaps you will not be able to[/left]
     spend as much time with either as much as you would[/left]
     like, but neither would be left out.[/left]"
9000.22,"22.    A friend has on several occassions made remarks[/left]
     about how much he likes a particular gold ring of[/left]
     yours. One day you discover that this ring is missing[/left]
     and after making a thorough search, find it in a coat[/left]
     your friend had left in your pantry. Are you most[/left]
     inclined to:[/left]
 a)  Ask your friend how he came about the ring, reasoning[/left]
     that it is highly probable that he found it and meant[/left]
     to return it to you.[/left]
 b)  Confront him with his theft. You know that there is no[/left]
     way the ring just fell into his pocket by accident,[/left]
     and therefore he is nothing but a common thief who[/left]
     would betray you for material gain.[/left]
c)  Say nothing, deciding instead to wait and see what[/left]
     your friend does. If he is innocent or guilty, you[/left]
     will know by whatever actions he takes. At that time,[/left]
     you can confront him with the truth.[/left]"
9000.23,"23.    A good friend of yours is in love with a girl from[/left]
     a neighboring village, a girl who barely knows him. He[/left]
     is extremely shy and inexperienced, and he pleads for[/left]
     your help. Would you suggest he:[/left]
 a)  Go to her immediately and declare his love. If the[/left]
     relationship is to be, he needs to be honest from the[/left]
     start. You offer to accompany him to the village for[/left]
     support.[/left]
 b)  Find out more about this girl using any contact he can[/left]
     find in her village. He will not be so shy if he knows[/left]
     something about her, and may even find out she is not[/left]
     the right girl for him.[/left]
c)  Let you help him write anonymous love letters and[/left]
     poems to see her reaction without needing to face her[/left]
     directly. If the reaction is favorable, he can talk to[/left]
     her friends in the village and arrange an ""accidental""[/left]
     meeting.[/left]"
9000.24,"24.    Your Armmaster is relating the story of a great[/left]
     king he knew in a faraway land whose inventors created[/left]
     a wondrous balloon of such size, it could transport[/left]
     dozens of people through the air to any place they[/left]
     chose. If you were this king, he asks you, how would[/left]
     you use this remarkable balloon? Would you:[/left]
a)  Explore regions previously impossible or extremely[/left]
     dangerous to visit by land.[/left]
 b)  Keep the balloon a secret, saving it for surprise[/left]
     attacks or defense in a time of war.[/left]
 c)  Commission the inventor to create dozens of these[/left]
     'balloons' in hopes of making a travel system across[/left]
     your realm that will speed up transportation time and[/left]
     the exchange of ideas.[/left]"
9000.25,"25.    There is a lot of heated discussion at the local[/left]
     tavern over a group of people called 'Telepaths'. They[/left]
     have been hired by certain City-State kings. Rumor has[/left]
     it these Telepaths read a person's mind and tell their[/left]
     lord whether a follower is telling the truth or not.[/left]
     You believe:[/left]
 a)  That this is a terrible practice. A person's thoughts[/left]
     are his own and no one, not even a king, has the right[/left]
     to make such an invasion into another human's mind.[/left]
 b)  Loyal followers to the King have nothing to fear from[/left]
     a Telepath. It is important to have a method of[/left]
     finding assassins and spies before it is too late.[/left]
 c)  In these times, it is a necessary evil. Although you[/left]
     do not necessarily like the idea, a Telepath could[/left]
     have certain advantages during a time of war or in[/left]
     finding someone innocent of a crime.[/left]"
9000.26,"26.    You are told that a young man has been caught by[/left]
     the village guards and accused of murder. Apparently,[/left]
     his brother was killed by a group of four ruffians in[/left]
     a local tavern, and in his grief, the young man[/left]
     tracked each of them down and murdered them. Upon[/left]
     reflection, you believe that:[/left]
 a)  The young man acted honorably in avenging his[/left]
     brother's death. The village lord should let him go[/left]
     free.[/left]
 b)  Even as you sympathize with the young man, vigilante[/left]
     law cannot be tolerated if there is to be peace.[/left]
 c)  The young man's only mistake was getting caught while[/left]
     exacting vengance. For that, he now must accept[/left]
     whatever fate has in store for him.[/left]"
9000.27,"27.    One night, walking home, you are attacked by a[/left]
     young man you know from class. You defend yourself[/left]
     ably and knock him unconscious. While he is out, you:[/left]
 a)  Tie him up, intending to interrogate him later when he[/left]
     wakes up. You want to know why he attacked you. You[/left]
     can then turn him into the Armsmaster at your leisure.[/left]
 b)  Slit his throat. You know him from class, and think he[/left]
     would have done the same had your positions been[/left]
     reversed.[/left]
c)  Leave him with a visible scar, the knowledge of his[/left]
     defeat at your hands and the visible reminder[/left]
     punishment enough for one who has resorted to such[/left]
     dishonorable tactics.[/left]"
9000.28,"28.    Your father delights in telling you stories of his[/left]
     travels in his youth. In one memorable tale, he tells[/left]
     you about a primitive island he visited where a young[/left]
     child was sacrificed once a year to appease Arius, the[/left]
     God of Fire. Whenever the natives neglected the[/left]
     sacrifice, the island volcano would erupt, killing[/left]
     hundreds of villagers. You tell your father:[/left]
 a)  You do not believe in any such Volcano God. Civilized[/left]
     men should intervene, find the natural cause behind[/left]
     the eruptions, and stop the sacrifices.[/left]
b)  The God Arius must be evil to demand child sacrifice.[/left]
     The villagers should find some way to combat this God,[/left]
     instead of just giving in to his demands.[/left]
 c)  It is tragic, but the death of one small child is[/left]
     preferable to that of many villagers. If it works,[/left]
     they should keep the tradition. Gods are not to be[/left]
     toyed with.[/left]"
9000.29,"29.    Your Armsmaster introduces a new student to the[/left]
     class - a small, awkward boy named Tys who does not[/left]
     seem to have any natural talent at all. The class is[/left]
     divided into two sides for a mock battle and, as one of[/left]
     the 'generals', you are to assign your soldiers. Tys[/left]
     is one of your men. You decide to:[/left]
a)  Put Tys at the frontline with the other fighters,[/left]
     rationalizing that in any realistic battle, he would[/left]
     probably be a casualty anyway, and that there must be[/left]
     some sacrifices.[/left]
 b)  Use Tys as a scout, rationalizing that because of his[/left]
     small size he would probably be good at sneaking in[/left]
     and gathering information on the enemy.[/left]
 c)  Assign Tys to several posts during the course of the[/left]
     battle, staying near and helping him so he can gain[/left]
     valuable experience and improve.[/left]"
9000.30,"30.    Your mother is terribly ill and you have been sent[/left]
     with a few gold pieces to buy some rare, medicinal[/left]
     herbs for her. As you reach the door to the[/left]
     apothecary's, you realize there is a hole in your purse[/left]
     and all the gold has fallen out. Do you:[/left]
a)  Enter the store, tell the apothecary your dilemma, and[/left]
     promise on your honor to pay him back for the herbs[/left]
     your mother so desperately needs.[/left]
 b)  Attempt to steal the herbs from the apothecary's. You[/left]
     know the old man who works in the store will not be[/left]
     able to catch you, and your mother lies sick.[/left]
 c)  Run back home and admit the loss, hoping that your[/left]
     father will have more gold. You know you'll be[/left]
     punished, but you will neither be in debt to the[/left]
     apothecary, nor will you be a thief.[/left]"
9000.31,"31.    A boat you are in is suddenly caught in a[/left]
     tremendous whirlpool. As the current reaches an[/left]
     impossible velocity, the little boat begins springing[/left]
     leaks and starts to sink under the vortex. You can see[/left]
     no way out that does not promise death, so you:[/left]
 a)  Pick up a bucket and begin bailing furiously, hoping[/left]
     to keep the boat afloat just a few more seconds.[/left]
 b)  Sit back and accept your fate, choosing to die with a[/left]
     sense of decorum and nobility, not as a commoner who[/left]
     fears the unknown.[/left]
 c)  Dive into the churning current. You may only be[/left]
     hastening your own death, but at least you are doing[/left]
     something.[/left]"
9000.32,"32.    You're hunting in the King's Hunt, a contest in[/left]
     which the best hunter will win riches enough to live[/left]
     comfortably for the rest of his or her life. You track[/left]
     a white stag many of you had shot at earlier. You are[/left]
     alone as you examine the stag and recognize the arrow[/left]
     as one fired from your friend's bow. As you retrieve[/left]
     the arrow for closer examination you hear your friends[/left]
     arrive. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Claim to have fired the arrow that hit the stag, thus[/left]
     gaining the honor for the kill?[/left]
 b)  Show the others the arrow and proclaim your friend the[/left]
     archer of the day?[/left]
c)  Suggest dividing the prize, reasoning that although[/left]
     your friend's arrow brought down the hart, all of you[/left]
     were instrumental in the tracking and the kill?[/left]"
9000.33,"33.    One night after Tales and Tallows, you look at the[/left]
     horde of treats you have collected and find lots of[/left]
     brandied plums, a treat you particularly dislike. You[/left]
     know your younger cousin likes them. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Give her all your brandied plums?[/left]
b)  Trade the brandied plums for something she does not[/left]
     really like but you do?[/left]
 c)  Pretend that they are excellent brandied plums and see[/left]
     if she will give up something really good in exchange?[/left]"
9000.34,"34.    Your cousin has given you a very embarassing[/left]
     nickname and, even worse, likes to call you it in front[/left]
     of your friends. You have asked him to stop, but he[/left]
     finds it very amusing to watch you blush. What do you     do?:[/left]
 a)  Make up an even more embarassing nickname for him and[/left]
     use it constantly until he learns his lesson.[/left]
 b)  Make up a story that makes your nickname a badge of[/left]
     honor instead of something humiliating.[/left]
 c)  Beat up your cousin, then tell him that if he ever[/left]
     calls you that nickname again, you will bloody him[/left]
     worse than this time.[/left]"
9000.35,"35.    Othisa, a friend, has been beaten by a boy several[/left]
     years older than either you or her. She asks for your[/left]
     help. Are you more inclined to:[/left]
 a)  Gather a bunch of friends together and ambush the boy,[/left]
     teaching him a lesson about bullying.[/left]
 b)  Tell Othisa to avoid the bully - no reason to make[/left]
     things worse than they are.[/left]
 c)  Challenge the older boy, knowing that you will[/left]
     probably take a beating, but confident that if you do[/left]
     it enough times, he will move on to pick on someone[/left]
     who is an easier target.[/left]"
9000.36,"36.    Your parents are having a party for several[/left]
     relatives. While helping around the house, you see your[/left]
     cousin slip into a darkened room. Curious, you follow[/left]
     and discover him slipping a silver candlestick into his[/left]
     jacket. He is an honorable boy, but you know his family[/left]
     has suffered some recent financial hardship. He has not[/left]
     seen you yet. Do you:[/left]
 a)  Clear your throat and tell him to put the candlestick[/left]
     back, reassuring him that your parents can help him if[/left]
     his family is in trouble, but he should not resort [/left]
     to stealing.[/left]
 b)  Close the door behind you and say nothing. Your family[/left]
     can live without the candlestick, but your cousin's[/left]
     family obviously cannot.[/left]
c)  Treat him like any other burgler. Lock him in the room[/left]
     and call for your father. If he chooses to be merciful[/left]
     because of your cousin's poverty, that is his decision.[/left]
     It is your father's candlestick, after all.[/left]"
9000.37,"37.    While exploring the woods with two other[/left]
     adventurers, you come across a small, abandoned hut[/left]
     that seems to have once belonged to a mage. Looking[/left]
     through the window, you see the remains of a[/left]
     laboratory, many potions and scrolls still on the[/left]
     shelves. Geotina, who thinks you a cowardly sort,[/left]
     suggests breaking into the shack and exploring. Another[/left]
     fighter named Hunard suggests going to town to find out[/left]
     more information. You advise:[/left]
a)  Going into town. They are more familiar with the area[/left]
     and may have important information about this hut and[/left]
     the surrounding area.[/left]
 b)  Breaking into the shack, but leaving one person on[/left]
     the outside in case something goes wrong. You should[/left]
     investigate new things, not run away from them.[/left]
 c)  Daring Geotina to go in first. If there is a trap, she[/left]
     can trip it, then you and Hunard can go in and explore[/left]
     at your leisure.[/left]"
9000.38,"38.    It is a particularly grueling class. Your[/left]
     Armsmaster has been unreasonably demanding on everyone,[/left]
     including you. His criticisms border on abuse, and it[/left]
     seems he has no positive comments to make. He turns to[/left]
     berate you at the end of class, and over his shoulder,[/left]
     you see some classmates put an aggressive but[/left]
     non-poisonous snake in his hand sack. You would:[/left]
 a)  Do nothing. The great Armsmaster needs a dose of[/left]
     humility and this might be a good way of paying him[/left]
     back for all the misery he has put you through today.[/left]
 b)  Tell him you saw a snake creep into his hand sack,[/left]
     but do not tell him what your classmates did. No[/left]
     reason to get anyone in even further trouble.[/left]
 c)  Immediately tell him what the classmates did. There[/left]
     is no excuse for treating a seasoned fighter like him[/left]
     with disrespect, regardless of his treatment to you[/left]
     that particular day.[/left]"
9000.39,"39.    Because you expressed interest, your Armsmaster[/left]
     told you a few hints about recognizing magical[/left]
     weaponry. Later you are practicing archery with a few[/left]
     friends. One boy who was never a strong archer has[/left]
     become something of a sharpshooter. You suddenly[/left]
     realize that he is using magical arrows. What do you[/left]
     do?:[/left]
 a)  Tell the others about the arrows. In a friendly[/left]
     archery match, using magical arrows is cheating.[/left]
 b)  Tell your friend you noticed that he was using magical[/left]
     arrows, and if he doesn't get you some, you will tell[/left]
     the Armsmaster and the others the reason behind his[/left]
     improvement.[/left]
 c)  Say nothing. If you have a need for magical arrows[/left]
     you can always mention something to him later. After[/left]
     all, magic is not really a cheat, it is a different[/left]
     skill.[/left]"
9000.40,"40.    Practicing alone, you develop a new fighting style[/left]
     you are very excited about. When you mention it to your[/left]
     Armsmaster, he tells you it would never work in[/left]
     practical combat. Do you:[/left]
a)  Use the new style in the middle of a class spar.[/left]
     When it works, he will be forced to admit its[/left]
     practicality or give a reason for not accepting it.[/left]
 b)  Keep asking him questions about it, focusing on[/left]
     details of the form to find his objection. Eventually[/left]
     he will have to give a more specific criticism.[/left]
 c)  Accept his word without question. Your Armsmaster has[/left]
     been fighting since your grandfather's day. He knows a[/left]
     flawed style when he sees it, and it is better not to[/left]
     waste his or your time asking why.[/left]"
