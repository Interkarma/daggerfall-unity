-- Total amount of classic DF quests (including broken): 249.
--   Main quests and tutorials: 36 (supported by the engine itself and not listed here)
--   Cure were/vamp: 2 (unsupported yet, not listed here)
-- The remaining 211 quests (including broken) and only them are listed here.

-- name:        filename of QRC txt file
-- group:       guild group from FactionFile.GuildGroups enum, or social group from FactionFile.SocialGroups enum
-- membership:  N=non-member, M=member, P=prospect, T=Akatosh, A=Arkay, D=Dibella, J=Julianos, K=Kynareth, R=Mara, S=Stendarr, Z=Zenithar
-- minReq:      minimum requirement to be offered the quest: (val < 10) = guild rank / player level, or (val >= 10) = min reputation
-- flag:        0 = nothing, X = adult/nudity, 1 = one time quest
-- notes:
-   "reward bug" is a script error where reward is given before quest completed
-   "questor clear bug" is a script error where clicking on questor will cause quest to end immediately after target complete
-   "no hot-placement" is a DFU bug where resources cannot be placed to an active interior/dungeon. Need to exit and re-enter interior
-   "needs more action support" means DFU quest system needs more development for these quests to work properly.
