      Editing Reputations is a optional

      feature which allows you to help determine how[/left]

      certain
      broad societal factions are inclined to[/left]

      react to someone of your

      These groups are by no means the only reputational[/left]

      groups

      and the most common.[/left]

      The
      base average of all the reputational groups[/left]

      together must always
      equal zero. Thus, if you add[/left]

      five points to your reputation with
      one group, you[/left]

      must subtract five from another.[/left]

      Your father

      you tried to hide your[/left]

      to
      days, and you numbly realized that you would never see[/left]

      your father
      again. The receipt of the Emperor''s reward[/left]

      seemed small consolation
      for your loss.[/left]

      you was your appetite.[/left]

      You were of an inquisitive nature. No

      fingers. You[/left]

      left no traces, but still your father and brothers

      you when they caught you. By the time you were eleven,[/left]

      they
      no longer caught you. Your mother taught you[/left]

      %q1 and %q2, but
      you had no other[/left]

      [/left]

      Once,
      you climbed the wall of the local %q3[/left]

      their equipment was left lying about you
      took it for your[/left]

      also adopted a jacket shed by its owner and wore it[/left]

      proudly about
      the village.[/left]

      One day, you saw some village boys
      hurling stones and[/left]

      insults at an old woman named %fn.[/left]

      Moved
      by an impulse you did not understand, you flung[/left]

      rocks back at
      the boys. They laughed, but as you drew[/left]

      near, they turned and
      ran away. You went back to[/left]

      %fn and offered to see her to her
      door.[/left]

      [/left]

      "Come inside," %fn said. "I have[/left]

      something
      for you." Her cottage was just one room, with[/left]

      cats and kittens
      everywhere. "Sit down," she said,[/left]

      removing two cats from a stool.
      "I''m going to teach you[/left]

      about %q4."[/left]

      [/left]

      "Why?"
      you asked.[/left]

      "The cats don''t need training in %q4,"[/left]

      %fn
      said. "You do. Or will. No matter."[/left]

      Thus your

      The procession was very
      splendid indeed, but a nearby[/left]

      rustle drew your attention. A black
      clad man was[/left]

      crouching on a limb ten feet beneath you. You gasped[/left]

      before
      you could stop yourself, and he twisted around,[/left]

      bringing his
      bow to bear on you. With no time to draw a[/left]

      weapon, you flung
      yourself at him, and together you[/left]

      crashed down on the heads below,
      just as the Emperor''s[/left]

      carriage drew abreast.[/left]

      Hands

      robed elf muttered

      cooled and your head cleared.

      odds with his otherwise gruff exterior.
      Your early years are[/left]

      recalled as an endless stream of days spent
      out of doors,[/left]

      wearing only loose clothing or the simple robe
      that your[/left]

      grandfather favored. He taught you about %q1[/left]

      and
      how to %q3 and %q9. And[/left]

      when there were no warding duties for
      him to perform, there[/left]

      was always weapons practice; your grandfather
      had mastered[/left]

      an incredible variety of weaponry, and insisted
      that you[/left]

      become familiar with each one. He was often required
      to deal[/left]

      with some forest predator that had been causing local[/left]

      problems,
      or with bands of brigands passing through the area,[/left]

      and you were
      proud whenever you were able to help.[/left]

      [/left]

      It was just
      such an outlaw band that caused the combat wound[/left]

      that was ultimately
      fatal to your grandfather. You and he were[/left]

      able to return to
      his home, and at first he tried to act as if[/left]

      this were just another
      scratch, to be allowed to naturally[/left]

      heal. But finally even he
      faced the inevitability of his age[/left]

      and accumulated injuries,
      and he gave you careful instructions[/left]

      concerning the disposition
      of his possessions. He also told[/left]

      you to go to a temple being
      run by an old friend of his, to[/left]

      continue your growth and sustain
      your %q1 training[/left]

      and allow you to continue %q3a.[/left]

      A
      few days later, your grandfather died with the quiet dignity[/left]

      that
      he had always displayed. You were distraught at the loss[/left]

      of the
      only friend and family that you had ever had, but you[/left]

      packed
      your few belongings and travelled to the temple,[/left]

      honoring your
      grandfather''s request.[/left]

      [/left]

      %fn, the chief priestess
      of the temple[/left]

      was an older woman, but she was much younger than
      your[/left]

      grandfather had been. You shared your sorrow with her for[/left]

      your
      recent loss. Then you agreed with her that, besides[/left]

      general training
      in %q1 and similar[/left]

      studies, you would ignore the set of courses
      dealing with[/left]

      armor and shields. To pay for your training, you
      used your[/left]

      forestry skills to provide a regular supply of fresh
      meat[/left]

      for the temple''s larder.[/left]

      [/left]

      Some
      years later, on a day that seemed like any other, you had[/left]

      just
      returned from collecting game for the food supply when the[/left]

      chief
      priestess came to see you. She told you that she received[/left]

      a message
      that an Imperial coach was ambushed at a location[/left]

      close to the
      temple, and that important people and material[/left]

      needed to be recovered.
      You allowed yourself an hour to perform[/left]

      your grandfather''s favorite
      meditation exercises, and left on[/left]

      this new mission both refreshed
      and with some insight[/left]

      concerning where to search for the robbers.
      Your meditations[/left]

      bore fruit at dusk, as you stealthily approached
      an encampment[/left]

      approximately where you had expected it to be.
      Throughout[/left]

      the night you gradually stalked and subdued the camp
      guard, but[/left]

      then you had to kill all of the other outlaws because
      they[/left]

      resisted capture. You were abashed to return to the temple[/left]

      shortly
      after breakfast with only one captive, a maidservant,[/left]

      and a mundane
      chest of government documents.[/left]

      [/left]

      However, when the
      Imperial representative arrived to claim[/left]

      your results, she sought
      you out to congratulate you on a most[/left]

      successful mission. Although
      you never knew for certain whether[/left]

      the maidservant or some of
      the documents somehow had importance,[/left]

      you were not surprised
      when you later received a most[/left]

      interesting letter from the Imperial
      Palace, simply inviting[/left]

      you to the palace on urgent business.
      You left the temple[/left]

      immediately for the Imperial City.[/left]

      about ten feet in front of you. You scrambled[/left]

      up a tree, and
      heard the wild man right behind you, grunting[/left]

      with glee. As you
      climbed higher, you heard a branch break[/left]

      under you and turned
      to see the man land hard on the ground.[/left]

      discovered

      several less
      fortunate rangers. You also found a ragged young[/left]

      boy in chains,
      evidently the meal you interrupted. After[/left]

      you freed him, he told
      you his name was %imp,[/left]

      first exposure to the distaste[/left]

      that some of the inhabitants and
      members of the court[/left]

      express toward someone of your physical

      %q1 skills with some actual fighting[/left]

      of the continent.
      You found it easy to transfer your[/left]

      early self-defensive inclinations
      to the caravan as a[/left]

      whole. Finally though, you decided to return
      to your[/left]

      home city and seek out your friend %fn.[/left]

      You

      your sympathy
      was won by a nervous, mute boy who kept[/left]

      the bar stocked. He seemed
      so frightened and alone that[/left]

      he reminded you of your own lonely
      childhood. When one[/left]

      of the drunken regulars stuck the boy, you
      leapt to his[/left]

      defense. The boy looked at you with such gratitude
      that[/left]

      your heart almost broke. Then, a few days later, he[/left]

      Months

      again. This time he
      was dressed in Imperial robes and[/left]

      surrounded by escorts including
      %fn.[/left]

      The "mute" boy spoke in an unmistakably aristocratic[/left]

      voice,
      "My name is Prince %imp, son of the[/left]

      all your training, you could not help but stop,[/left]

      stunned, when
      the shadow hissed at you and turned, revealing[/left]

      itself to be a
      cloaked goblin, dagger in hand. With hardly[/left]

      time for a thought,
      your instincts took over and the[/left]

      wooden sword in your hand swung
      out and knocked[/left]

      the goblin cold. Still shaking, you called for
      the[/left]

      guard.[/left]

      [/left]

      In the morning you were
      summoned before the Emperor.[/left]

      Dressed in borrowed armor, not quite
      the right size you[/left]

      walked into the throne room, dwarfed by its
      size. Bowing[/left]

      before the Emperor you took the oath of knighthood
      and[/left]

      were received into the ranks of Heraldry. It was not two[/left]

      days
      from then that you received word that the Emperor[/left]

      had a quest
      for you, one that required the utmost tact[/left]

      and unswerving loyalty.
      When you came to the palace that[/left]

      night, you were surprised to
      find that the Emperor was[/left]

      not surrounded by his usual large retinue,
      merely his[/left]

      chief advisor, the Imperial Battlemage Ocato. There
      you[/left]

      were told of the affair of Daggerfall.[/end]'

    m_Localized: 'Ria Silmane was a powerful enchantress, one of the Elders[/left]

      of
      the Imperial Council, and a worthy successor to the[/left]

      Imperial
      Battlemage when Jagar Tharn elected to retire.[/left]

      She was also a
      friend of yours, your first tutor in the[/left]

      Imperial City. When
      she disappeared, you were the first[/left]

      person to notice and begin
      an investigation. You must[/left]

      have been getting close, for you were
      ambushed by agents[/left]

      of the Emperor and thrown into a cell deep
      within the[/left]

      sewers, with no food or water. It was there that Ria[/left]

      Silmane
      found you.[/left]

      [/left]

      Ria appeared to you as a spectre, for
      she too had been[/left]

      betrayed by the man who now, with the ultimate
      gall,[/left]

      dared to impersonate the Emperor: Jagar Tharn, her former[/left]

      master.
      The true Emperor was imprisoned by Tharn''s magic.[/left]

      Only you would
      be able to find the flaw in Jagar Tharn''s[/left]

      spell, free the Emperor,
      and expose the traitorous[/left]

      Battlemage.[/left]

      [/left]

      With
      Ria''s help, you escaped from your cell, and under her[/left]

      direction,
      you began the quest for the Staff of Chaos.[/left]

      Tharn had used the
      Staff to imprison the true Emperor and[/left]

      had then broken it, scattering
      it in secure locations[/left]

      throughout the Empire. Nearly ten years
      passed while Tharn[/left]

      consolidated his power and Ria''s spectral
      form slowly[/left]

      dissolved, but at last you found all the pieces of
      the[/left]

      Staff of Chaos and combined them to form the key to the[/left]

      prison
      of the true Emperor. The final piece of the staff[/left]

      was a gem hidden
      in the Imperial Palace itself.[/left]

      [/left]

      Jagar Tharn had
      surrounded himself with a host of guards,[/left]

      human and otherwise.
      When you at last reached the gem, you[/left]

      discovered why they had
      fought so furiously. The gem not[/left]

      only freed the Emperor, but
      it destroyed Tharn, for the[/left]

      Imperial Battlemage had used his
      own lifeforce to empower[/left]

      the Staff.[/left]

      [/left]

      When
      the true Emperor once again assumed the throne, he[/left]

      considered
      himself greatly in your debt. You were often[/left]

      called upon to investigate
      evidence of Tharn''s aborted[/left]

      master plan, and though you discovered
      little of great[/left]

      relevance, you were well rewarded. Still, you
      were not[/left]

      often at court. The Emperor almost considered you a
      rare[/left]

      and valued weapon, to be drawn only away from others''[/left]

      eyes.[/left]

      [/left]

      When
      the Emperor told you of the haunting of King[/left]

      Lysandus, your instinct
      told you that the Emperor was[/left]

      not telling you the entire story.
      Nevertheless, even[/left]

      if he did consider you a friend, the Emperor''s
      word was[/left]

      law, and you boarded a ship that very night for[/left]

      Daggerfall.[/left]

      You suddenly[/left]\n     realize that he is using magical arrows. What do
      you[/left]\n     do?:[/left]\n a)  Tell the others about the arrows. In a friendly[/left]\n    
      archery match, using magical arrows is cheating.[/left]\n b)  Tell your friend
      you noticed that he was using magical[/left]\n     arrows, and if he doesn't
      get you some, you will tell[/left]\n     the Armsmaster and the others the
      reason behind his[/left]\n     improvement.[/left]\n c)  Say nothing. If you
      have a need for magical arrows[/left]\n     you can always mention something
      to him later. After[/left]\n     all, magic is not really a cheat, it is a
      different[/left]\n     skill.[/left]"

    m_Localized: "40.    Practicing alone, you develop a new fighting style[/left]\n    
      you are very excited about. When you mention it to your[/left]\n     Armsmaster,
      he tells you it would never work in[/left]\n     practical combat. Do you:[/left]\n
      a)  Use the new style in the middle of a class spar.[/left]\n     When it works,
      he will be forced to admit its[/left]\n     practicality or give a reason for
      not accepting it.[/left]\n b)  Keep asking him questions about it, focusing
      on[/left]\n     details of the form to find his objection. Eventually[/left]\n    
      he will have to give a more specific criticism.[/left]\n c)  Accept his word
      without question. Your Armsmaster has[/left]\n     been fighting since your
      grandfather's day. He knows a[/left]\n     flawed style when he sees it, and
      it is better not to[/left]\n     waste his or your time asking why.[/left]"
