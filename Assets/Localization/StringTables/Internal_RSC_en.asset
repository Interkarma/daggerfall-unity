      Editing Reputations is a optional

      feature which allows you to help determine how[/left]

      certain
      broad societal factions are inclined to[/left]

      react to someone of your

      These groups are by no means the only reputational[/left]

      groups

      and the most common.[/left]

      The
      base average of all the reputational groups[/left]

      together must always
      equal zero. Thus, if you add[/left]

      five points to your reputation with
      one group, you[/left]

      must subtract five from another.[/left]

      Your father

      you tried to hide your[/left]

      to
      days, and you numbly realized that you would never see[/left]

      your father
      again. The receipt of the Emperor''s reward[/left]

      seemed small consolation
      for your loss.[/left]

      you was your appetite.[/left]

      You were of an inquisitive nature. No

      fingers. You[/left]

      left no traces, but still your father and brothers

      you when they caught you. By the time you were eleven,[/left]

      they
      no longer caught you. Your mother taught you[/left]

      %q1 and %q2, but
      you had no other[/left]

      [/left]

      Once,
      you climbed the wall of the local %q3[/left]

      their equipment was left lying about you
      took it for your[/left]

      also adopted a jacket shed by its owner and wore it[/left]

      proudly about
      the village.[/left]

      One day, you saw some village boys
      hurling stones and[/left]

      insults at an old woman named %fn.[/left]

      Moved
      by an impulse you did not understand, you flung[/left]

      rocks back at
      the boys. They laughed, but as you drew[/left]

      near, they turned and
      ran away. You went back to[/left]

      %fn and offered to see her to her
      door.[/left]

      [/left]

      "Come inside," %fn said. "I have[/left]

      something
      for you." Her cottage was just one room, with[/left]

      cats and kittens
      everywhere. "Sit down," she said,[/left]

      removing two cats from a stool.
      "I''m going to teach you[/left]

      about %q4."[/left]

      [/left]

      "Why?"
      you asked.[/left]

      "The cats don''t need training in %q4,"[/left]

      %fn
      said. "You do. Or will. No matter."[/left]

      Thus your

      The procession was very
      splendid indeed, but a nearby[/left]

      rustle drew your attention. A black
      clad man was[/left]

      crouching on a limb ten feet beneath you. You gasped[/left]

      before
      you could stop yourself, and he twisted around,[/left]

      bringing his
      bow to bear on you. With no time to draw a[/left]

      weapon, you flung
      yourself at him, and together you[/left]

      crashed down on the heads below,
      just as the Emperor''s[/left]

      carriage drew abreast.[/left]

      Hands

      robed elf muttered

      cooled and your head cleared.

      odds with his otherwise gruff exterior.
      Your early years are[/left]

      recalled as an endless stream of days spent
      out of doors,[/left]

      wearing only loose clothing or the simple robe
      that your[/left]

      grandfather favored. He taught you about %q1[/left]

      and
      how to %q3 and %q9. And[/left]

      when there were no warding duties for
      him to perform, there[/left]

      was always weapons practice; your grandfather
      had mastered[/left]

      an incredible variety of weaponry, and insisted
      that you[/left]

      become familiar with each one. He was often required
      to deal[/left]

      with some forest predator that had been causing local[/left]

      problems,
      or with bands of brigands passing through the area,[/left]

      and you were
      proud whenever you were able to help.[/left]

      [/left]

      It was just
      such an outlaw band that caused the combat wound[/left]

      that was ultimately
      fatal to your grandfather. You and he were[/left]

      able to return to
      his home, and at first he tried to act as if[/left]

      this were just another
      scratch, to be allowed to naturally[/left]

      heal. But finally even he
      faced the inevitability of his age[/left]

      and accumulated injuries,
      and he gave you careful instructions[/left]

      concerning the disposition
      of his possessions. He also told[/left]

      you to go to a temple being
      run by an old friend of his, to[/left]

      continue your growth and sustain
      your %q1 training[/left]

      and allow you to continue %q3a.[/left]

      A
      few days later, your grandfather died with the quiet dignity[/left]

      that
      he had always displayed. You were distraught at the loss[/left]

      of the
      only friend and family that you had ever had, but you[/left]

      packed
      your few belongings and travelled to the temple,[/left]

      honoring your
      grandfather''s request.[/left]

      [/left]

      %fn, the chief priestess
      of the temple[/left]

      was an older woman, but she was much younger than
      your[/left]

      grandfather had been. You shared your sorrow with her for[/left]

      your
      recent loss. Then you agreed with her that, besides[/left]

      general training
      in %q1 and similar[/left]

      studies, you would ignore the set of courses
      dealing with[/left]

      armor and shields. To pay for your training, you
      used your[/left]

      forestry skills to provide a regular supply of fresh
      meat[/left]

      for the temple''s larder.[/left]

      [/left]

      Some
      years later, on a day that seemed like any other, you had[/left]

      just
      returned from collecting game for the food supply when the[/left]

      chief
      priestess came to see you. She told you that she received[/left]

      a message
      that an Imperial coach was ambushed at a location[/left]

      close to the
      temple, and that important people and material[/left]

      needed to be recovered.
      You allowed yourself an hour to perform[/left]

      your grandfather''s favorite
      meditation exercises, and left on[/left]

      this new mission both refreshed
      and with some insight[/left]

      concerning where to search for the robbers.
      Your meditations[/left]

      bore fruit at dusk, as you stealthily approached
      an encampment[/left]

      approximately where you had expected it to be.
      Throughout[/left]

      the night you gradually stalked and subdued the camp
      guard, but[/left]

      then you had to kill all of the other outlaws because
      they[/left]

      resisted capture. You were abashed to return to the temple[/left]

      shortly
      after breakfast with only one captive, a maidservant,[/left]

      and a mundane
      chest of government documents.[/left]

      [/left]

      However, when the
      Imperial representative arrived to claim[/left]

      your results, she sought
      you out to congratulate you on a most[/left]

      successful mission. Although
      you never knew for certain whether[/left]

      the maidservant or some of
      the documents somehow had importance,[/left]

      you were not surprised
      when you later received a most[/left]

      interesting letter from the Imperial
      Palace, simply inviting[/left]

      you to the palace on urgent business.
      You left the temple[/left]

      immediately for the Imperial City.[/left]

      about ten feet in front of you. You scrambled[/left]

      up a tree, and
      heard the wild man right behind you, grunting[/left]

      with glee. As you
      climbed higher, you heard a branch break[/left]

      under you and turned
      to see the man land hard on the ground.[/left]

      discovered

      several less
      fortunate rangers. You also found a ragged young[/left]

      boy in chains,
      evidently the meal you interrupted. After[/left]

      you freed him, he told
      you his name was %imp,[/left]

      first exposure to the distaste[/left]

      that some of the inhabitants and
      members of the court[/left]

      express toward someone of your physical

      %q1 skills with some actual fighting[/left]

      of the continent.
      You found it easy to transfer your[/left]

      early self-defensive inclinations
      to the caravan as a[/left]

      whole. Finally though, you decided to return
      to your[/left]

      home city and seek out your friend %fn.[/left]

      You

      your sympathy
      was won by a nervous, mute boy who kept[/left]

      the bar stocked. He seemed
      so frightened and alone that[/left]

      he reminded you of your own lonely
      childhood. When one[/left]

      of the drunken regulars stuck the boy, you
      leapt to his[/left]

      defense. The boy looked at you with such gratitude
      that[/left]

      your heart almost broke. Then, a few days later, he[/left]

      Months

      again. This time he
      was dressed in Imperial robes and[/left]

      surrounded by escorts including
      %fn.[/left]

      The "mute" boy spoke in an unmistakably aristocratic[/left]

      voice,
      "My name is Prince %imp, son of the[/left]

      all your training, you could not help but stop,[/left]

      stunned, when
      the shadow hissed at you and turned, revealing[/left]

      itself to be a
      cloaked goblin, dagger in hand. With hardly[/left]

      time for a thought,
      your instincts took over and the[/left]

      wooden sword in your hand swung
      out and knocked[/left]

      the goblin cold. Still shaking, you called for
      the[/left]

      guard.[/left]

      [/left]

      In the morning you were
      summoned before the Emperor.[/left]

      Dressed in borrowed armor, not quite
      the right size you[/left]

      walked into the throne room, dwarfed by its
      size. Bowing[/left]

      before the Emperor you took the oath of knighthood
      and[/left]

      were received into the ranks of Heraldry. It was not two[/left]

      days
      from then that you received word that the Emperor[/left]

      had a quest
      for you, one that required the utmost tact[/left]

      and unswerving loyalty.
      When you came to the palace that[/left]

      night, you were surprised to
      find that the Emperor was[/left]

      not surrounded by his usual large retinue,
      merely his[/left]

      chief advisor, the Imperial Battlemage Ocato. There
      you[/left]

      were told of the affair of Daggerfall.[/end]'

    m_Localized: 'Ria Silmane was a powerful enchantress, one of the Elders[/left]

      of
      the Imperial Council, and a worthy successor to the[/left]

      Imperial
      Battlemage when Jagar Tharn elected to retire.[/left]

      She was also a
      friend of yours, your first tutor in the[/left]

      Imperial City. When
      she disappeared, you were the first[/left]

      person to notice and begin
      an investigation. You must[/left]

      have been getting close, for you were
      ambushed by agents[/left]

      of the Emperor and thrown into a cell deep
      within the[/left]

      sewers, with no food or water. It was there that Ria[/left]

      Silmane
      found you.[/left]

      [/left]

      Ria appeared to you as a spectre, for
      she too had been[/left]

      betrayed by the man who now, with the ultimate
      gall,[/left]

      dared to impersonate the Emperor: Jagar Tharn, her former[/left]

      master.
      The true Emperor was imprisoned by Tharn''s magic.[/left]

      Only you would
      be able to find the flaw in Jagar Tharn''s[/left]

      spell, free the Emperor,
      and expose the traitorous[/left]

      Battlemage.[/left]

      [/left]

      With
      Ria''s help, you escaped from your cell, and under her[/left]

      direction,
      you began the quest for the Staff of Chaos.[/left]

      Tharn had used the
      Staff to imprison the true Emperor and[/left]

      had then broken it, scattering
      it in secure locations[/left]

      throughout the Empire. Nearly ten years
      passed while Tharn[/left]

      consolidated his power and Ria''s spectral
      form slowly[/left]

      dissolved, but at last you found all the pieces of
      the[/left]

      Staff of Chaos and combined them to form the key to the[/left]

      prison
      of the true Emperor. The final piece of the staff[/left]

      was a gem hidden
      in the Imperial Palace itself.[/left]

      [/left]

      Jagar Tharn had
      surrounded himself with a host of guards,[/left]

      human and otherwise.
      When you at last reached the gem, you[/left]

      discovered why they had
      fought so furiously. The gem not[/left]

      only freed the Emperor, but
      it destroyed Tharn, for the[/left]

      Imperial Battlemage had used his
      own lifeforce to empower[/left]

      the Staff.[/left]

      [/left]

      When
      the true Emperor once again assumed the throne, he[/left]

      considered
      himself greatly in your debt. You were often[/left]

      called upon to investigate
      evidence of Tharn''s aborted[/left]

      master plan, and though you discovered
      little of great[/left]

      relevance, you were well rewarded. Still, you
      were not[/left]

      often at court. The Emperor almost considered you a
      rare[/left]

      and valued weapon, to be drawn only away from others''[/left]

      eyes.[/left]

      [/left]

      When
      the Emperor told you of the haunting of King[/left]

      Lysandus, your instinct
      told you that the Emperor was[/left]

      not telling you the entire story.
      Nevertheless, even[/left]

      if he did consider you a friend, the Emperor''s
      word was[/left]

      law, and you boarded a ship that very night for[/left]

      Daggerfall.[/left]

      There is a draft for a romantic poem in your victim''s

      leg trapped in a hunter's clawsnare. Judging from the[/left]\n    bleeding
      it will not survive long. Do you:[/left]\n a) Draw your dagger, mercifully
      ending its life[/left]\n    with a single thrust?[/left]\n b) Do not interfere
      in the natural evolution of events,[/left]\n    but rather take the opportunity
      to learn more about[/left]\n    a strange animal that you have never seen[/left]\n   
      before?[/left]\n c) Use herbs from your pack to put it to sleep, then[/left]\n   
      free it from the clawsnare and take it somewhere[/left]\n    where it can be
      safe, knowing that in doing so you[/left]\n    will probably deprive a hunter
      and his family of[/left]\n    sustenance?[/left]\n {2.   One summer afternoon
      your father gives you a choice[/left]\n    of chores. Would you rather:[/left]\na)
      Work in the forge with him casting iron for a new plow?[/left]\n b) Gather
      herbs for your mother who is preparing dinner?[/left]\n c) Go catch fish at
      the stream using a net and line?[/left]\n {3.   Your father and you are returning
      from the town[/left]\n    market when you see a small boy running from a store.[/left]\n   
      In his hands he clutches a loaf of bread. Behind him[/left]\n    races the
      baker with a cleaver in his hands. You know[/left]\n    that the boy must be
      hungry, but the town is suffering[/left]\n    from a drought, which has made
      food valuable. Do you:[/left]\n a) Side with justice and urge your father to
      stop the boy?[/left]\n b) Help the poor waif by running into the baker's way?[/left]\nc)
      Stand out of the way and wait to see what your father[/left]\n    decides,
      trusting his experience?[/left]\n {4.   Your father tells you one night the
      story of his[/left]\n    battle at Borim Valley, where his men had routed the[/left]\n   
      enemy. They would have captured them all if not for the[/left]\n    brave sacrifice
      of a young Sergeant on the opposing[/left]\n    side, who held a pass long
      enough for his men to[/left]\n    retreat to safety. He had done so knowing
      that it would[/left]\n    cost him his life. If you had been that man would
      you[/left]\n    have:[/left]\n a) Fled, rationalizing that your experience
      with battle[/left]\n    tactics was too valuable to be wasted, and could make[/left]\n   
      the difference later?[/left]\n b) Held the pass also, so that the men under
      your command[/left]\n    could flee, though it meant your life?[/left]\n c)
      Searched for some means to distract the enemy so that[/left]\n    your men
      might have the possibility of escaping, but[/left]\n    not at the cost of
      your own life?[/left]\n {5.   Your mother sends you to the market with a list
      of[/left]\n    goods to buy. After you finish you find that by mistake[/left]\n   
      a shopkeeper has given you too much money back in[/left]\n    exchange for
      one of the items. Do you:[/left]\n a) Return to the store and give the shopkeeper
      his hard-[/left]\n    earned money, explaining to him the mistake?[/left]\nb)
      Pocket the extra money, knowing that shopkeepers in[/left]\n    general tend
      to overcharge customers anyway?[/left]\n c) Decide to put the extra money to
      good use and purchase[/left]\n    items that would help your family?[/left]\n{6.  
      While in a market place you witness a thief cut a[/left]\n    purse from a
      noble. Even as he does so the noble[/left]\n    notices and calls for the city
      guards. In his haste to[/left]\n    get away, the thief drops the purse near
      you.[/left]\n    Surprisingly, no one seems to notice the bag of coins[/left]\n   
      at your feet. Do you: [/left]\n a) Pick up the bag and pocket it, knowing that
      the extra[/left]\n    windfall will help your family in times of trouble?[/left]\nb)
      Pick up the bag and signal to the guard, knowing that[/left]\n    the only
      honorable thing to do is return the money to[/left]\n    its rightful owner?[/left]\nc)
      Leave the bag there, knowing that it is better not to[/left]\n    get involved?[/left]\n{7.  
      Your father sends you on a task which you loathe,[/left]\n    cleaning the
      stables. On the way there, pitchfork in[/left]\n    hand, you run into your
      friend from the homestead near[/left]\n    your own. He offers to do it for
      you, in return for a[/left]\n    future favor of his choosing. Do you:[/left]\na)
      Decline his offer, knowing that your father expects you[/left]\n    to do the
      work, and it is better not to be in debt?[/left]\n b) Accept his offer, reasoning
      that as long as the stables[/left]\n    are cleaned, it matters not who does
      the cleaning?[/left]\n c) Ask him to help you, knowing that two people can
      do the[/left]\n    job faster than one, and agree to help him with one[/left]\n   
      task of his choosing in the future?[/left]\n {8.   Your mother asks you to
      help fix the stove. While[/left]\n     you are working, a very hot pipe slips
      its moorings[/left]\n     and falls towards her. Do you:[/left]\n a) Push your
      mother out of the way?[/left]\n b) Grab the hot pipe and try and push it away?[/left]\nc)
      Position yourself between the pipe and your mother?[/left]\n {9.   While in
      town the baker gives you a sweetroll.[/left]\n    Delighted, you take it into
      an alley to enjoy, only to[/left]\n    be intercepted by a gang of three other
      kids your age.[/left]\n    The leader demands the sweetroll, or else he and
      his[/left]\n    friends will beat you and take it. Do you:[/left]\na) Drop
      the sweetroll and step on it, then get ready for[/left]\n    the fight?[/left]\nb)
      Give him the sweetroll now without argument, knowing[/left]\n    that later
      this afternoon you will have all your[/left]\n    friends with you and can
      come and take whatever he[/left]\n    owes you?[/left]\n c) Act like you're
      going to give him the sweetroll but[/left]\n    at the last minute throw it
      in the air, hoping that[/left]\n    they'll pay attention to it long enough
      for you to get[/left]\n    a shot in on the leader?[/left]\n {10.    Entering
      town you find that you are witness to a[/left]\n     very well dressed man
      running from a crowd. He screams[/left]\n     to you for help. The crowd behind
      him seems very[/left]\n     angry. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Rush to the man's aid
      immediately, despite your lack[/left]\n     of knowledge of the circumstances?[/left]\nb) 
      Rush to the town's aid immediately, despite your lack[/left]\n     of knowledge
      of the circumstances?[/left]\n c)  Stand aside and allow the man and mob to
      pass,[/left]\n     realizing that it is probably best not to get involved?[/left]\n{11.   
      You and your best friend buy your first daggers[/left]\n     together, a matched
      pair. You loan him the amount[/left]\n     since he doesn't have enough gold,
      and he agrees to[/left]\n     pay you back later. After leaving the shop you
      and he[/left]\n     sit down to marvel at your new weapons. To your dismay[/left]\n    
      you notice that there is a small notch on the blade[/left]\n     of the dagger
      you selected. Your friend asks you to[/left]\n     please watch his weapon
      for him while he runs an[/left]\n     errand. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Wait for
      your friend's return then point out the flaw[/left]\n     in your dagger and
      return to the weapons shop to[/left]\n     demand a refund.[/left]\nb)  Switch
      the daggers, rationalizing that since you paid[/left]\n     for them you should
      get the first choice, and that if[/left]\n     your friend ever notices the
      notch, you could always[/left]\n     take him back to the weapon shop and get
      a refund?[/left]\n c)  Keep his dagger safe until his return, then switch the[/left]\n    
      daggers with your best friend's knowledge, justifying[/left]\n     it with
      the fact that you paid for them, and then[/left]\n     offer to accompany him
      back to the weapons shop?[/left]\n {12.    You are at weapons practice. Your
      Armsmaster is[/left]\n     very old now, but takes his teaching very seriously.[/left]\n    
      You have heard him say it is all he has left in life.[/left]\n     Today he
      has ceaselessly taunted you at every mistake.[/left]\n     Finally he asks
      you to attack him with the same[/left]\n     technique you just did, in an
      effort to show you the[/left]\n     proper execution. Do you:[/left]\n a) 
      Do the technique just fast enough so that he can block[/left]\n     it, knowing
      that it is more important to allow the[/left]\n     master to retain dignity,
      regardless of your personal[/left]\n     feelings?[/left]\n b)  Attack him
      at full speed, knowing that you could[/left]\n     probably score the hit and
      justify his unfair[/left]\n     treatment of you by showing the class that
      you were[/left]\n     actually doing it right?[/left]\n c)  Refuse and leave
      practice, unable to compromise your[/left]\n     anger with his dignity, and
      realizing that whatever[/left]\n     course you choose would cause you to lose
      respect for[/left]\n     either him or for yourself?[/left]\n {13.    While
      throwing a ball to you your friend breaks a[/left]\n     window on his house.
      His father rushes out and demands[/left]\n     to know who broke the window.
      You know that your[/left]\n     friend's father is a strict disciplinarian
      and will[/left]\n     punish your friend severely if he takes the blame. You[/left]\n    
      on the other hand, not being his son, could get away[/left]\n     virtually
      unscathed. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Raise your hand and take the blame before your
      friend[/left]\n     can answer?[/left]\n b)  Remain silent and not get involved?[/left]\nc) 
      Point at your friend, knowing that anything else would[/left]\n     probably
      delay the inevitable and make things just[/left]\n     that much worse for
      him?[/left]\n {14.    Your Armsmaster during a lesson on strategy[/left]\n    
      remarks, 'The best victory is to completely and[/left]\n     totally humiliate
      your opponent'. He then turns to you[/left]\n     and asks you if you agree
      with him. You know the[/left]\n     Armsmaster has been in numerous life and
      death[/left]\n     conflicts and has the experience of a seasoned[/left]\n    
      warrior. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Agree with his remark, knowing that at this moment[/left]\n    
      your experience is not enough to justify any stance[/left]\n     but total
      agreement with whatever your Armsmaster[/left]\n     says, a man who has dedicated
      his life to strategy?[/left]\n b)  Disagree with his remark, reasoning that
      it must be[/left]\n     some type of test, and that the truth will only come[/left]\n    
      from opposition with his opinion, and not sheep-like[/left]\n     agreement?[/left]\nc) 
      Refuse to answer the question, choosing to withhold an[/left]\n     opinion
      until you have more experience and can[/left]\n     converse on the subject
      in an intelligent manner with[/left]\n     him?[/left]\n {15.    The senior
      student in your weapons class has[/left]\n     trounced you unmercifully for
      the past several years.[/left]\n     Today is the Tournament of Students and
      you find with[/left]\n     dismay that you are paired against him for your
      first[/left]\n     match. As you prepare your friend approaches and[/left]\n    
      offers to tell you of an injury the senior student[/left]\n     suffered in
      yesterday's sparring class, which you[/left]\n     missed. Do you:[/left]\na) 
      Accept the offer, knowing that it would allow you to[/left]\n     concentrate
      on the injured area and greatly increase[/left]\n     your chances of beating
      him?[/left]\n b)  Refuse the offer, knowing that win or lose you would[/left]\n    
      rather do it through your own skill and not some extra[/left]\n     knowledge
      in what should be a fair and honorable[/left]\n     fight?[/left]\n c)  Accept
      the offer, reasoning that it is better to have[/left]\n     the knowledge in
      case you need it, and realizing that[/left]\n     having the knowledge does
      not necessarily mean using[/left]\n     it?[/left]\n {16.    An old man stops
      you on the way to market,[/left]\n     claiming to have been robbed. He is
      lying on the trail[/left]\n     and seems gravely injured. He asks you to run
      to town[/left]\n     and get the constable. You give him your word that you[/left]\n    
      will go directly to town and bring the constable back.[/left]\n     As you
      make your way back you notice a suspicious man[/left]\n     creeping along
      another trail. He doesn't seem to[/left]\n     notice you yet. Do you:[/left]\na) 
      Follow the man, reasoning that if this man is the[/left]\n     robber you could
      lead the constable directly to him[/left]\n     and safeguard other travelers,
      although it would mean[/left]\n     breaking your word?[/left]\n b)  Take note
      of him but continue on, reasoning that the[/left]\n     man on the trail is
      hurt too badly to stop, regardless[/left]\n     of any other consideration?[/left]\nc) 
      Take note of him but continue on, reasoning that your[/left]\n     word is
      your bond and that it takes precedence over[/left]\n     anything else?[/left]\n{17.   
      While fishing one sunny afternoon you find that the[/left]\n     boots which
      you discarded are now full of ants who are[/left]\n     busily making their
      way from a piece of bread you[/left]\n     dropped to their anthill. Do you:[/left]\na) 
      Pick up the boots wash all the ants off now, even[/left]\n     though you are
      not leaving until dusk?[/left]\n b)  Watch the ants, curious as to how they
      work so[/left]\n     efficiently, and content to live and let live?[/left]\nc) 
      Make boats out of leaves and then send each ant down[/left]\n     the stream
      to pass the time until a fish bites?[/left]\n {18.    You hear the Armsmaster
      remark during weapons[/left]\n     class, 'The intent of your opponent can
      be seen in his[/left]\n     blade'. Many of the students scoff at this, though
      not[/left]\n     openly. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Feel that the disrespect the
      students show at this[/left]\n     points to something which they do not understand,
      and[/left]\n     therefore causes you to focus your efforts on[/left]\n    
      understanding it all the more?[/left]\n b)  Feel that he means the way the
      opponent attacks and[/left]\n     moves shows you how he feels?[/left]\n c) 
      Realize that Armsmaster Festil should not be the[/left]\n     object of scorn,
      but rather one of respect, for he has[/left]\n     lived a full life and survived
      things none of the[/left]\n     students could imagine?[/left]\n {19.    The
      town has a lottery in which the winning chit[/left]\n     is called. You look
      in shock as the winning chit[/left]\n     number matches your own! Before you
      can say anything[/left]\n     another family walks forward. You have seen them
      before[/left]\n     and know that they are extremely poor. Your family on[/left]\n    
      the other hand could do without the 100 gold piece[/left]\n     prize. Do you:[/left]\na) 
      Say nothing and allow the other family to claim the[/left]\n     prize?[/left]\nb) 
      Stand and show your chit, knowing that the prize is[/left]\n     rightfully
      yours?[/left]\n c)  Stand and show your chit, and offer to split the prize[/left]\n    
      in half with the other family?[/left]\n {20.    Your Armsmaster poses a question
      one day to his[/left]\n     class. A company of 100 men is attempting to flee
      from[/left]\n     the enemy. There are two paths out of the broken[/left]\n    
      stronghold. One path will kill half the men under the[/left]\n     officers
      command, but the other half would survive. The[/left]\n     other path has
      a fifty percent chance that everyone[/left]\n     would die, but also a fifty
      percent chance that[/left]\n     everyone would survive. As the commanding
      officer,[/left]\n     would you:[/left]\n a)  Choose the path that would guarantee
      half your men[/left]\n     would survive?[/left]\n b)  Choose the path that
      has a fifty percent chance that[/left]\n     all would survive, and a fifty
      percent chance that all[/left]\n     would perish?[/left]\n c)  Turn the choice
      over to the men and let them decide by[/left]\n     majority vote which path
      they should commit[/left]\n     themselves to?[/left]\n {21.    You have a
      great aunt and a great uncle living in[/left]\n     two different nearby villages,
      both of whom have asked[/left]\n     your father to allow you to live with
      them for a few[/left]\n     weeks.[/left]\n     Your father knows where he
      plans to send you, but he[/left]\n     is curious about your opinion. Given
      the choice, would[/left]\n     you rather:[/left]\n a)  Live with your great
      aunt -- a wise old woman of[/left]\n     considerable wealth. Living in luxury
      for a few weeks[/left]\n     could not only be enlightening, it could also
      be very[/left]\n     interesting.[/left]\n b)  Live with your great uncle --
      a sick old man who has[/left]\n     always been something of a stranger to
      you. A few[/left]\n     weeks with him may be arduous, but he is in more need[/left]\n    
      of your help than your great aunt.[/left]\n c)  Think of a way to divide your
      time between your great[/left]\n     aunt and great uncle. Perhaps you will
      not be able to[/left]\n     spend as much time with either as much as you would[/left]\n    
      like, but neither would be left out.[/left]\n {22.    A friend has on several
      occasions made remarks[/left]\n     about how much he likes a particular gold
      ring of[/left]\n     yours. One day you discover that this ring is missing[/left]\n    
      and after making a thorough search, find it in a coat[/left]\n     your friend
      had left in your pantry. Are you most[/left]\n     inclined to: a)  Ask your
      friend how he came about the ring, reasoning[/left]\n     that it is highly
      probable that he found it and meant[/left]\n     to return it to you.[/left]\nb) 
      Confront him with his theft. You know that there is no[/left]\n     way the
      ring just fell into his pocket by accident,[/left]\n     and therefore he is
      nothing but a common thief who[/left]\n     would betray you for material gain.[/left]\nc) 
      Say nothing, deciding instead to wait and see what[/left]\n     your friend
      does. If he is innocent or guilty, you[/left]\n     will know by whatever actions
      he takes. At that time,[/left]\n     you can confront him with the truth.[/left]\n{23.   
      A good friend of yours is in love with a girl from[/left]\n     a neighboring
      village, a girl who barely knows him. He[/left]\n     is extremely shy and
      inexperienced, and he pleads for[/left]\n     your help. Would you suggest
      he:[/left]\n a)  Go to her immediately and declare his love. If the[/left]\n    
      relationship is to be, he needs to be honest from the[/left]\n     start. You
      offer to accompany him to the village for[/left]\n     support.[/left]\nb) 
      Find out more about this girl using any contact he can[/left]\n     find in
      her village. He will not be so shy if he knows[/left]\n     something about
      her, and may even find out she is not[/left]\n     the right girl for him.[/left]\nc) 
      Let you help him write anonymous love letters and[/left]\n     poems to see
      her reaction without needing to face her[/left]\n     directly. If the reaction
      is favorable, he can talk to[/left]\n     her friends in the village and arrange
      an \"accidental\"[/left]\n     meeting.[/left]\n {24.    Your Armsmaster is
      relating the story of a great[/left]\n     king he knew in a faraway land whose
      inventors created[/left]\n     a wondrous balloon of such size, it could transport[/left]\n    
      dozens of people through the air to any place they[/left]\n     chose. If you
      were this king, he asks you, how would[/left]\n     you use this remarkable
      balloon? Would you:[/left]\n a)  Explore regions previously impossible or extremely[/left]\n    
      dangerous to visit by land.[/left]\n b)  Keep the balloon a secret, saving
      it for surprise[/left]\n     attacks or defense in a time of war.[/left]\nc) 
      Commission the inventor to create dozens of these[/left]\n     'balloons' in
      hopes of making a travel system across[/left]\n     your realm that will speed
      up transportation time and[/left]\n     the exchange of ideas.[/left]\n{25.   
      There is a lot of heated discussion at the local[/left]\n     tavern over a
      group of people called 'Telepaths'. They[/left]\n     have been hired by certain
      City-State kings. Rumor has[/left]\n     it these Telepaths read a person's
      mind and tell their[/left]\n     lord whether a follower is telling the truth
      or not.[/left]\n     You believe:[/left]\n a)  That this is a terrible practice.
      A person's thoughts[/left]\n     are his own and no one, not even a king, has
      the right[/left]\n     to make such an invasion into another human's mind.[/left]\nb) 
      Loyal followers to the King have nothing to fear from[/left]\n     a Telepath.
      It is important to have a method of[/left]\n     finding assassins and spies
      before it is too late.[/left]\n c)  In these times, it is a necessary evil.
      Although you[/left]\n     do not necessarily like the idea, a Telepath could[/left]\n    
      have certain advantages during a time of war or in[/left]\n     finding someone
      innocent of a crime.[/left]\n {26.    You are told that a young man has been
      caught by[/left]\n     the village guards and accused of murder. Apparently,[/left]\n    
      his brother was killed by a group of four ruffians in[/left]\n     a local
      tavern, and in his grief, the young man[/left]\n     tracked each of them down
      and murdered them. Upon[/left]\n     reflection, you believe that:[/left]\na) 
      The young man acted honorably in avenging his[/left]\n     brother's death.
      The village lord should let him go[/left]\n     free. b)  Even as you sympathize
      with the young man, vigilante[/left]\n     law cannot be tolerated if there
      is to be peace.[/left]\n c)  The young man's only mistake was getting caught
      while[/left]\n     exacting vengeance. For that, he now must accept[/left]\n    
      whatever fate has in store for him.[/left]\n {27.    One night, walking home,
      you are attacked by a[/left]\n     young man you know from class. You defend
      yourself[/left]\n     ably and knock him unconscious. While he is out, you:[/left]\na) 
      Tie him up, intending to interrogate him later when he[/left]\n     wakes up.
      You want to know why he attacked you. You[/left]\n     can then turn him into
      the Armsmaster at your leisure.[/left]\nb)  Slit his throat. You know him from
      class, and think he[/left]\n     would have done the same had your positions
      been[/left]\n     reversed.[/left]\nc)  Leave him with a visible scar, the
      knowledge of his[/left]\n     defeat at your hands and the visible reminder[/left]\n    
      punishment enough for one who has resorted to such[/left]\n     dishonorable
      tactics.[/left]\n {28.    Your father delights in telling you stories of his[/left]\n    
      travels in his youth. In one memorable tale, he tells[/left]\n     you about
      a primitive island he visited where a young[/left]\n     child was sacrificed
      once a year to appease Arius, the[/left]\n     God of Fire. Whenever the natives
      neglected the[/left]\n     sacrifice, the island volcano would erupt, killing[/left]\n    
      hundreds of villagers. You tell your father:[/left]\n a)  You do not believe
      in any such Volcano God. Civilized[/left]\n     men should intervene, find
      the natural cause behind[/left]\n     the eruptions, and stop the sacrifices.[/left]\nb) 
      The God Arius must be evil to demand child sacrifice.[/left]\n     The villagers
      should find some way to combat this God,[/left]\n     instead of just giving
      in to his demands.[/left]\n c)  It is tragic, but the death of one small child
      is[/left]\n     preferable to that of many villagers. If it works,[/left]\n    
      they should keep the tradition. Gods are not to be[/left]\n     toyed with.[/left]\n
      {29.    Your Armsmaster introduces a new student to the[/left]\n     class
      - a small, awkward boy named Tys who does not[/left]\n     seem to have any
      natural talent at all. The class is[/left]\n     divided into two sides for
      a mock battle and, as one of[/left]\n     the 'generals', you are to assign
      your soldiers. Tys[/left]\n     is one of your men. You decide to:[/left]\na) 
      Put Tys at the frontline with the other fighters,[/left]\n     rationalizing
      that in any realistic battle, he would[/left]\n     probably be a casualty
      anyway, and that there must be[/left]\n     some sacrifices.[/left]\n b)  Use
      Tys as a scout, rationalizing that because of his[/left]\n     small size he
      would probably be good at sneaking in[/left]\n     and gathering information
      on the enemy.[/left]\n c)  Assign Tys to several posts during the course of
      the[/left]\n     battle, staying near and helping him so he can gain[/left]\n    
      valuable experience and improve.[/left]\n {30.    Your mother is terribly ill
      and you have been sent[/left]\n     with a few gold pieces to buy some rare,
      medicinal[/left]\n     herbs for her. As you reach the door to the[/left]\n    
      apothecary's, you realize there is a hole in your purse[/left]\n     and all
      the gold has fallen out. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Enter the store, tell the apothecary
      your dilemma, and[/left]\n     promise on your honor to pay him back for the
      herbs[/left]\n     your mother so desperately needs.[/left]\n b)  Attempt to
      steal the herbs from the apothecary's. You[/left]\n     know the old man who
      works in the store will not be[/left]\n     able to catch you, and your mother
      lies sick.[/left]\n c)  Run back home and admit the loss, hoping that your[/left]\n    
      father will have more gold. You know you'll be[/left]\n     punished, but you
      will neither be in debt to the[/left]\n     apothecary, nor will you be a thief.[/left]\n{31.   
      A boat you are in is suddenly caught in a[/left]\n     tremendous whirlpool.
      As the current reaches an[/left]\n     impossible velocity, the little boat
      begins springing[/left]\n     leaks and starts to sink under the vortex. You
      can see[/left]\n     no way out that does not promise death, so you:[/left]\na) 
      Pick up a bucket and begin bailing furiously, hoping[/left]\n     to keep the
      boat afloat just a few more seconds.[/left]\n b)  Sit back and accept your
      fate, choosing to die with a[/left]\n     sense of decorum and nobility, not
      as a commoner who[/left]\n     fears the unknown.[/left]\n c)  Dive into the
      churning current. You may only be[/left]\n     hastening your own death, but
      at least you are doing[/left]\n     something.[/left]\n {32.    You're hunting
      in the King's Hunt, a contest in[/left]\n     which the best hunter will win
      riches enough to live[/left]\n     comfortably for the rest of his or her life.
      You track[/left]\n     a white stag many of you had shot at earlier. You are[/left]\n    
      alone as you examine the stag and recognize the arrow[/left]\n     as one fired
      from your friend's bow. As you retrieve[/left]\n     the arrow for closer examination
      you hear your friends[/left]\n     arrive. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Claim to have
      fired the arrow that hit the stag, thus[/left]\n     gaining the honor for
      the kill?[/left]\n b)  Show the others the arrow and proclaim your friend the[/left]\n    
      archer of the day?[/left]\n c)  Suggest dividing the prize, reasoning that
      although[/left]\n     your friend's arrow brought down the hart, all of you[/left]\n    
      were instrumental in the tracking and the kill?[/left]\n {33.    One night
      after Tales and Tallows, you look at the[/left]\n     horde of treats you have
      collected and find lots of[/left]\n     brandied plums, a treat you particularly
      dislike. You[/left]\n     know your younger cousin likes them. Do you:[/left]\na) 
      Give her all your brandied plums?[/left]\n b)  Trade the brandied plums for
      something she does not[/left]\n     really like but you do?[/left]\n c)  Pretend
      that they are excellent brandied plums and see[/left]\n     if she will give
      up something really good in exchange?[/left]\n {34.    Your cousin has given
      you a very embarrassing[/left]\n     nickname and, even worse, likes to call
      you it in front[/left]\n     of your friends. You have asked him to stop, but
      he[/left]\n     finds it very amusing to watch you blush. What do you     do?:[/left]\na) 
      Make up an even more embarrassing nickname for him and[/left]\n     use it
      constantly until he learns his lesson.[/left]\n b)  Make up a story that makes
      your nickname a badge of[/left]\n     honor instead of something humiliating.[/left]\nc) 
      Beat up your cousin, then tell him that if he ever[/left]\n     calls you that
      nickname again, you will bloody him[/left]\n     worse than this time.[/left]\n{35.   
      Othisa, a friend, has been beaten by a boy several[/left]\n     years older
      than either you or her. She asks for your[/left]\n     help. Are you more inclined
      to:[/left]\n a)  Gather a bunch of friends together and ambush the boy,[/left]\n    
      teaching him a lesson about bullying.[/left]\n b)  Tell Othisa to avoid the
      bully - no reason to make[/left]\n     things worse than they are.[/left]\n
      c)  Challenge the older boy, knowing that you will[/left]\n     probably take
      a beating, but confident that if you do[/left]\n     it enough times, he will
      move on to pick on someone[/left]\n     who is an easier target.[/left]\n{36.   
      Your parents are having a party for several[/left]\n     relatives. While helping
      around the house, you see your[/left]\n     cousin slip into a darkened room.
      Curious, you follow[/left]\n     and discover him slipping a silver candlestick
      into his[/left]\n     jacket. He is an honorable boy, but you know his family[/left]\n    
      has suffered some recent financial hardship. He has not[/left]\n     seen you
      yet. Do you:[/left]\n a)  Clear your throat and tell him to put the candlestick[/left]\n    
      back, reassuring him that your parents can help him if[/left]\n     his family
      is in trouble, but he should not resort [/left]\n     to stealing.[/left]\n
      b)  Close the door behind you and say nothing. Your family[/left]\n     can
      live without the candlestick, but your cousin's[/left]\n     family obviously
      cannot.[/left]\nc)  Treat him like any other burglar. Lock him in the room[/left]\n    
      and call for your father. If he chooses to be merciful[/left]\n     because
      of your cousin's poverty, that is his decision.[/left]\n     It is your father's
      candlestick, after all.[/left]\n {37.    While exploring the woods with two
      other[/left]\n     adventurers, you come across a small, abandoned hut[/left]\n    
      that seems to have once belonged to a mage. Looking[/left]\n     through the
      window, you see the remains of a[/left]\n     laboratory, many potions and
      scrolls still on the[/left]\n     shelves. Geotina, who thinks you a cowardly
      sort,[/left]\n     suggests breaking into the shack and exploring. Another[/left]\n    
      fighter named Hunard suggests going to town to find out[/left]\n     more information.
      You advise:[/left]\n a)  Going into town. They are more familiar with the area[/left]\n    
      and may have important information about this hut and[/left]\n     the surrounding
      area.[/left]\n b)  Breaking into the shack, but leaving one person on[/left]\n    
      the outside in case something goes wrong. You should[/left]\n     investigate
      new things, not run away from them.[/left]\n c)  Daring Geotina to go in first.
      If there is a trap, she[/left]\n     can trip it, then you and Hunard can go
      in and explore[/left]\n     at your leisure.[/left]\n {38.    It is a particularly
      grueling class. Your[/left]\n     Armsmaster has been unreasonably demanding
      on everyone,[/left]\n     including you. His criticisms border on abuse, and
      it[/left]\n     seems he has no positive comments to make. He turns to[/left]\n    
      berate you at the end of class, and over his shoulder,[/left]\n     you see
      some classmates put an aggressive but[/left]\n     non-poisonous snake in his
      hand sack. You would:[/left]\n a)  Do nothing. The great Armsmaster needs a
      dose of[/left]\n     humility and this might be a good way of paying him[/left]\n    
      back for all the misery he has put you through today.[/left]\n b)  Tell him
      you saw a snake creep into his hand sack,[/left]\n     but do not tell him
      what your classmates did. No[/left]\n     reason to get anyone in even further
      trouble.[/left]\n c)  Immediately tell him what the classmates did. There[/left]\n    
      is no excuse for treating a seasoned fighter like him[/left]\n     with disrespect,
      regardless of his treatment to you[/left]\n     that particular day.[/left]\n{39.   
      Because you expressed interest, your Armsmaster[/left]\n     told you a few
      hints about recognizing magical[/left]\n     weaponry. Later you are practicing
      archery with a few[/left]\n     friends. One boy who was never a strong archer
      has[/left]\n     become something of a sharpshooter. You suddenly[/left]\n    
      realize that he is using magical arrows. What do you[/left]\n     do?:[/left]\na) 
      Tell the others about the arrows. In a friendly[/left]\n     archery match,
      using magical arrows is cheating.[/left]\n b)  Tell your friend you noticed
      that he was using magical[/left]\n     arrows, and if he doesn't get you some,
      you will tell[/left]\n     the Armsmaster and the others the reason behind
      his[/left]\n     improvement.[/left]\n c)  Say nothing. If you have a need
      for magical arrows[/left]\n     you can always mention something to him later.
      After[/left]\n     all, magic is not really a cheat, it is a different[/left]\n    
      skill.[/left]\n {40.    Practicing alone, you develop a new fighting style[/left]\n    
      you are very excited about. When you mention it to your[/left]\n     Armsmaster,
      he tells you it would never work in[/left]\n     practical combat. Do you:[/left]\na) 
      Use the new style in the middle of a class spar.[/left]\n     When it works,
      he will be forced to admit its[/left]\n     practicality or give a reason for
      not accepting it.[/left]\n b)  Keep asking him questions about it, focusing
      on[/left]\n     details of the form to find his objection. Eventually[/left]\n    
      he will have to give a more specific criticism.[/left]\n c)  Accept his word
      without question. Your Armsmaster has[/left]\n     been fighting since your
      grandfather's day. He knows a[/left]\n     flawed style when he sees it, and
      it is better not to[/left]\n     waste his or your time asking why.[/left]\n{[/end]"
