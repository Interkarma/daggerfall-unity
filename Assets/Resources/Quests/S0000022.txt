RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     I thought I told you it would
<ce>                    take a month. The powder is not
<ce>                      ready yet. Come back later.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   The powder is ready. All you need
<ce>                    to do is spinkle it on his true
<ce>                    corpse. I must warn you. It will
<ce>                  not put his shade to rest, but will
<ce>                  soothe it sufficiently to allow you
<ce>                 a chance to speak with him. The final
<ce>                  exorcism is for Lysandus to choose.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                   I do not know where he was buried.
<ce>                 I do know that it is not on the field
<ce>                  of Cryngaine where they erected that
<ce>                  monument to him. If you do speak to
<ce>                    him...could you tell him I still
<ce>                     love him. Death will not be a
<ce>                        barrier to us for long.

%qdt:
 Medora has given me a powder that will
 soothe the spirit of Lysandus. However,
 it will not lay his shade to rest, but
 only calm it. Now I need only to find
 his tomb and use it.
