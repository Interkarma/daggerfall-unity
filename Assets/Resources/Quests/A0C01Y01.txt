<ce>                    %pcn, I fear for my very life.
<ce>                    Will you protect me? _villains_s
<ce>              have threatened to kill me tonight because I
<ce>                have refused to sell my land. I can pay
<ce>                            you _gold_ gold.
                                     <--->
<ce>               You find me in desperate straits, my dear
<ce>                  %ra. I have received word from some
<ce>                 %cn thugs that they intend to ransack
<ce>                my house tonight.  I don't suppose you'd
<ce>                  be available to do a little creative
<ce>                 facial rearrangement on these fellows?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Fear not for my safety, %pcn. I
<ce>                shall find another protector...somehow.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Thank you and bless you! They will strike at
<ce>                 _qgiverhome_ in the three hours before
<ce>              midnight. Be there and wait with me for that
<ce>               time. Once they have been defeated, I will
<ce>                          be safe once again.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 You have saved my life, %pcf. I will
<ce>                 gladly pay you our agreed upon amount.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                    _qgiver_ is in trouble with the
<ce>                Thieves Guild. I hear they are going to
<ce>                             rough %g2 up.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                    I saw _qgiver_ recently. %g was
<ce>                        beaten up by some thugs.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                        Aren't you the %ra that
<ce>                  chased off those thugs that tried to
<ce>                           beat up _qgiver_?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                 I still remember what you did for me
<ce>                     %pcf. Chasing off those thugs
<ce>                        leaves me in your debt.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                I still have the scars from when those
<ce>                 thugs found me. I hired you to protect
<ce>                 me and you blew it. Get away from me.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
On %qdt,
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_ asked
 me to protect %g2. _villains_s have
 threatened to assault %g2 between
 9 and midnight at _qgiverhome_.

Message:  1011
<ce>               This is not your problem, stranger. Leave
<ce>                   _qgiver_ to us or we will cut you
<ce>                         down where you stand!

Message:  1013
<ce>                  This must be the place. It fits the
<ce>                     description _qgiver_ gave you.
