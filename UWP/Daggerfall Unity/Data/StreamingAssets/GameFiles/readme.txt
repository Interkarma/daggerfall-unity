Place Daggerfall's game data files into this folder to start game without requiring directory selection.

Structure must look like below:

/StreamingAssets
  /GameFiles
    /ARENA2
    /SAVE0
    /SAVE1
    /SAVE2
    /SAVE3
    /SAVE4
    /SAVE5

ARENA2 must be a full install with all .VID files present.
SAVE0 - SAVE5 are classic save folders. Copy your classic save contents here to enable import into Daggerfall Unity.
