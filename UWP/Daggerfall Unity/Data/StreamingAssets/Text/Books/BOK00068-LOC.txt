[/center] In the spring of the year Doth propriety disappear In the
courts and the ports Of the Bay. Drinking new beer, Everybody
feels queer And the Earls and the churls Go astray. The bee and
the bird Don't have to tell us a word. Our bodies for
naughties Are prime. If you haven't heard, You can let
yourself be lured For the youth, for things uncouth, It is
time. Oh, it's lovely to sit in a field, harvested into rows
It's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any clothes.
People of the Bay bless The flowered court of Wayrest For
showing us the gentle way of sin The bonny Dark Elf queen Likes
to see and to be seen With cobblers, thieves, And tavernkeeps,
And slaves, and fish-er-men In the court of Lainlyn, Right
upon the mainland With sex, the whole place is in a whirl The
Baroness likes to play With men who come her way, While the
Baron likes the little boys and girls. Oh, it's lovely to
give your lady a kiss upon her nose  It's lovelier still to
do the same not wearing any clothes. In Daggerfall, they
hold a ball And all of society indulges in a variety Of
scandal, they can handle -- A lot. The Captain of the Guard Has to search very hard For
a bean that the Queen Has in her pants. And the Court Sorceress
Will grant you a wish To cause the King to fling About his
lance. Oh, it's lovely to give your love a single perfect
rose It's lovelier still to do the same not wearing any
clothes. Oh, it's lovely to abandon all your cares and
fears and woes It's lovelier still to do the same not
wearing any clothes. Yes sir, it's lovely not wear any
clothes!"
