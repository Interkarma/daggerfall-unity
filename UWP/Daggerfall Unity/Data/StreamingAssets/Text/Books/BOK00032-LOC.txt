[/center] This tale comes from sometime in the 2nd Era, most probably
after the time of the Knahaten Flu, or at least I have so
surmised due to reasons in the text. Whether or not the tale
is true, it remains an interesting story of survival.

 The reader will, I trust, forgive me if I translated the
epic somewhat informally. The message, I think, is
universal, and should not be misread.

 Enjoy, gentle reader.

      The Grey Falcon , a small warship of the         Sumurset
Isle, Was patrolling deep in the ocean for a         pirate That
had been looting the coast. The first three weeks out were
uneventful. Two hours after sunset, on the 22nd day        
out of port, The lookout spotted a top of a sail in         the
moonlight, Just on the horizon. "Sail! To starboard,
forward quarter!" The lookout of the Grey Falcon cried. The
crew and captain of the Grey Falcon        were quickly
roused, And stumbled to the deck.  "'Tis the ship we're looking
for, Captain,"        said the lookout.  "All hands to battle
stations! All archers        to their posts," The Captain
yelled, "Full ahead!" The two ships closed, And a dark figure
stepped out onto the        forecastle of the pirate ship. The
figure made a gesture with his hands, And a giant ball of
fire streaked towards        the Grey Falcon. The ball of fire
struck the Grey Falcon        in her sails, Quickly catching
them aflame. The figure made another gesture. Large bolts
of ice streaked out from his        hands, And hit the Grey
Falcon just above and below        the water line, Gouging
large holes in her hull.  The Grey Falcon was mortally
wounded. The Captain cried, "All hands abandon shi-" As he
was cut off by a pirate's arrow shot        into his throat.  As
the Grey Falcon, aflame and listing badly,        plunged
into the sea, One of her sailors, Darik Seaspit, Managed avoid
the pirate arrows and spells        to make his way to a
lifeboat, And lowered it into the darkness below. Just as the
lifeboat entered the water, a        quick grey shape jumped
into it. Darik looked, and saw it was Helnor Snarlsbane, A
Khajiit mercenary assigned to the ship. The two rowed the
small boat away, As the Grey Falcon finished her descent
into        the sea. In the darkness, the Pirate ship missed their   
    small craft. After the two rowed well out of the pirates  
     possible view, They both collapsed from exhaustion.
Early morning the next day, They took an inventory of the
lifeboats stores. Normally the lifeboat carries enough food
and        water To supply seven  people for at least ten
days. In place of the food, though, Helnor found a note:   
"The food in this lifeboat was found  to be        in
violation     of Sumerset Navy regulation during
inspection.     In accordance to that article, the food was    
   taken away     and destroyed.     A replacement may be
obtained by redeeming        this letter     at the Port Supply
Office.     Signed, Lt. Inspector Windhollow" Helnor read
aloud. Said Darik, to his Khajiit Companion, "We have       
plenty of water, but we are out of food. I don't know what
we're        going to do. I suppose we could try fishing, but
we have no        bait. "There's no chance we can make it back to
land Before we starve to death - 'twill be over a month       
in this craft" "Wait, I have an idea" said Helnor, with a
gleam        in his catlike eye. Six weeks later, the lifeboat
entered the port of        Corwich. As it was tethered to the
dock, a solitary figure        was pulled out, Looking
weather beaten and thin. One of the dock workers peered into
the life raft, After the figure was taken away to the port
healer        for treatment. "Hmm, what's this", a worker said
to himself, As he picked up a large bone from the boat, A bone
bleached white by the sun. After the sole survivor of the
Grey Falcon recovered        from his ordeal, He was taken to
the inquest for the death        of Darik Seaspit, And placed on
a chair before the magistrate.  "We here in High Rock have a dim
view of cannibalism. You'd better have a good reason for
your actions," The inquisitor boomed at Helnor Snarlsbane,  
    "By the Lady, do you?" Helnor stood, and said, "Your
Honor, I had no choice. There was no food, and it was at
least two months to       the closest port. We both decided this
was the only way someone would       make it" "Well, then , I
suppose that is understandable, If somewhat distasteful,"
the inquisitor said. "You think it was distasteful?," Helnor
muttered to       himself, "I didn't have any seasoning."    
"One final thing, Mr. Snarlsbane, How was it decided that
you would be the one that       would dine on the other? The
toss of a coin?" Helnor drew himself up and said, "Your
honor, it was very simple. Darik Seaspit was       a
vegetarian" "Case dismissed!"
