QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                      I am _qgiver_ of ==qgiver_.
<ce>                     I have a most dangerous quest
<ce>                        %pcn. You are one of the
<ce>                      few that could possibly take
<ce>                      it on. A lich is raising an
<ce>                    army of undead. We need someone
<ce>                     to go in and put a stop to it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                          I understand, %pcn.
<ce>                     This is too dangerous even for
<ce>                    you. There are one or two other
<ce>                      heroes that might be able to
<ce>                     pull this one off. I'll go ask
<ce>                                 them.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    You are brave indeed. The lich
<ce>                       has made ___dungeon_ into
<ce>                     its lair. Go there and destroy
<ce>                    the foul thing. In =2dung_ days
<ce>                     we will send out someone else,
<ce>                         should you not return.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        Hail to the hero, %pcn!
<ce>                      Well done! You name will be
<ce>                     recorded in all the histories.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The Great Lich of ___dungeon_ is awake again.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The Lich of ___dungeon_ went across the Bay, I hear.
<--->
The Lich is gathering forces outside of %reg.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Thank %god for ==qgiver_. They saved us all.
<--->
A %ra from ==qgiver_ destroyed the Lich of ___dungeon_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I would be honored to help you in any way, hero.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
After the ___dungeon_ debacle, you have a lot of nerve returning.
<--->
I trusted you to slay that lich. Think of my situation!

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 ==qgiver_ in ___qgiver_
 charged me with the duty of
 destroying the lich of
 ___dungeon_. I have =2dung_
 days to finish the task.

Message:  1011
<ce>                       The lich is dead. Without
<ce>                        his magical support, the
<ce>                     army of undead will return to
<ce>                               the grave.
