QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  Yes, this is a potentially awkward
<ce>                  situation I'm in. Not the worst, but
<ce>                  awkward indeed. I'm in possession of
<ce>                   a certain ... item that is not, to
<ce>                  be blunt, legally mine. If you would
<ce>                     carry it to a contact of mine in
<ce>                        ___contact_, you will be
<ce>                handsomely rewarded. Does _reward_ gold
<ce>                       pieces sound fair to you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     You abandon me in my hour of
<ce>                           need, young %ra. I
<ce>                         am sorely displeased.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  You will help me? %god be praised.
<ce>                      Now, hurry, take this _item_
<ce>                          and go to __contact_
<ce>                          in ___contact_. Look
<ce>                            for a =contact_
<ce>                            named _contact_.
<ce>                  Don't think about taking the _item_
<ce>                      elsewhere. If you're not in
<ce>                        __contact_ in =queston_
<ce>                       days, _contact_ will come
<ce>                      looking for you. Now, hurry,
<ce>                        time is of the essence.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                        Why are you still here?
<ce>                       My instructions were quite
<ce>                       clear, now carry them out.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                          Good day, %pcf. I'm
<ce>                          _contact_. Thank you
<ce>                  for your discretion in this matter.
<ce>                    You will find that discretion is
<ce>                    a valuable quality. Here is your
<ce>                           payment. Good day.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Those guards are even searching _questgiver_'s house for that _item_ shipment.
<--->
It's a complete mystery where that _item_ disappeared. Everyone's curious.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
What an embarrassment for _questgiver_. The stolen _item_ was traced to %g2.
<--->
I hear _questgiver_ tried to smuggle the _item_ to ___contact_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The guards have given up their search for that stolen _item_.
<--->
Imagine them suspecting that _questgiver_ had something to do with that _item_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Lovely to see you again, %pcf. I understand that your mission was accomplished.
<--->
I'm glad you returned, %pcf. You helped me out of a potential embarrassment.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  My contact says you never arrived.
<ce>                  That was very unprofessional, %pcf.
<ce>                    Now leave me. I have work to do.

Message:  1011
_questgiver_ is a rather small-time ruler, but a big-time _item_ smuggler.
<--->
_questgiver_'s in over %g3 head in this _item_ smuggling business.

Message:  1012
Supposedly _contact_ is a fence for stolen merchandise.
<--->
_contact_, eh? A mysterious =contact_ who operates out of __contact_, %di of here.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
I have accepted a
 mission from _questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_ to bring a stolen
 _item_ to _contact_,
 at __contact_ in ___contact_.
 I have =queston_ days to get
 the _item_ to ___contact_.

Message:  1023
Who is calling 1023?
