QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  If you would not mind doing a small
<ce>                    favor for me, I can put in your
<ce>                  possession a most excellent reward,
<ce>                      _artifact_. I have a child,
<ce>                   apparently miserable with all the
<ce>                    blessings I have given him, who
<ce>                   needs ... what is the euphemism?
<ce>                     To be taught a lesson? A very
<ce>                    serious lesson. Does this sound
<ce>                   like an agreeable contract, %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   I am gravely disappointed, %pct.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 Seldom am I summoned, even rarer are
<ce>                    the occasions when I am free to
<ce>                 answer a summoning. To be perfectly
<ce>                  blunt, this was a waste of my very
<ce>                            precious time.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Ah, good. This child of mine is a
<ce>                  wereboar who has made his den in a
<ce>                       place called ___mondung_.
<ce>                You should have no trouble finding it.
<ce>                   After you have put him out of his
<ce>                 obvious misery, which should not take
<ce>                  more than =1stparton_ days, go to a
<ce>                place called __contact_ in ___contact_
<ce>                and look for a person named _contact_.
<ce>           If you arrive there within =1stparton_ days from
<ce>                  now with the wereboar dead, %g will
<ce>                         give you _artifact_.
<ce>                  A pleasure doing business with you,
<ce>                     %pct. Good luck and farewell.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                           Listen, %pcf, you
<ce>                    and I both know that wereboar's
<ce>                    still breathing. A contract is
<ce>                              a contract.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       Hello, %pcf. You made it.
<ce>                     Hircine's impressed with you,
<ce>                   which is no small accomplishment.
<ce>                         Here's _artifact_ you
<ce>                       were promised. Take care.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Real nasty squeals and grunts coming out of ___mondung_, %di of here.
<--->
I hear there's some kind of mad half-pig thing in ___mondung_ to the %di.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That pig-thing that was here ran up north, like there was something after it.
<--->
Wonder what would spook a wereboar, make it run away like it did.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Real quiet around ___mondung_ lately.
<--->
Wonder what happened to that pig-thing that used to run around these parts.

Message:  1011
The least of the daedra princes. He is their Master of the Hunt.
<--->
Hircine is supposed to be the creator of all lycanthropes.

Message:  1012
Some weird-acting =contact_ in __contact_, %di of here.
<--->
A =contact_ by that name was in __contact_, %di of here, fairly recently.

Message:  1013
<ce>                 I have no idea what _artifact_ does.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 In return for _artifact_
 I have been asked by the Daedra
 Prince Hircine to slay a wereboar
 in ___mondung_.
 The wereboar must be dead in =1stparton_ days,
 and I must be in __contact_ in ___contact_
 in =1stparton_ days to meet with _contact_,
 a =contact_, about _artifact_.

Message:  1030
<ce>                         The wereboar is dead,
<ce>                        as you promised Daedra
<ce>                            Prince Hircine.
