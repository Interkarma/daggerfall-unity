QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 Ah, here's something to appeal to the
<ce>                        romantic in you, %pcf: a
<ce>                    caddish knight has besmeared the
<ce>                 honor of a fair damsel and refuses to
<ce>                  fight any who would defend her. The
<ce>                 poor girl did the only thing she could
<ce>                 do, and now we have some accounting to
<ce>                   do. You're interested, I take it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     No? I would have thought this
<ce>                    would be your good cheer. Well,
<ce>                     we have plenty more accounters
<ce>                     with a soft spot for corrupted
<ce>                                wenches.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                As I thought. We think the knight does
<ce>                 not yet know about the contract, being
<ce>                 deeply entrenched in a fortress called
<ce>                      ___mondung_. Obviously, this
<ce>                 ill-bred warrior doesn't want to make
<ce>                this too easy on us. Well, the contract
<ce>             calls for the accounting to be in =1stparton_
<ce>                  days and for you to report back here
<ce>                      within that time. Go to it,
<ce>                 %pcf. Defend that poor soiled damsel.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    I don't hear the thanks of our
<ce>                   client, so I take it the knight's
<ce>                    still among the living. Hurry up
<ce>                     and fix that oversight, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    So the rogue knight has entered
<ce>                the hereafter, yes? Perhaps in his next
<ce>                 incarnation he will have the wisdom to
<ce>                  keep his sword sheathed. Well done,
<ce>                            as usual, %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That soldier is one mangy mutt, I'll tell you. No honor whatsoever.
<--->
I hear that lady tried to seduce the knight and failed. That's why she's upset.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That warrior has moved on to new lands to corrupt their gentle womenfolk.
<--->
The soldier has left ____questgiver_ like a hurricane, leaving broken hearts behind.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
That soldier got what was coming to %g2 if you ask me. What a cad!
<--->
Good that someone isn't afraid to defend a damsel. Damned abominable rogue.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I'd be enchanted to help the knight-slayer any way I can.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   What makes you think that I'd be
<ce>                    interested in talking with a %ra
<ce>                     who can't even slay one lousy
<ce>                    knight. Leave my sight at once.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 _questgiver_, of The Dark Brotherhood
 in ___questgiver_, has sent me to
 ___mondung_ to find and slay a knight.
 The deed is to be done in =1stparton_ days.

Message:  1021
<ce>                       "Tell _damsel_...that she
<ce>                     can share soiled...honor with
<ce>                       every farmboy...in %reg,"
<ce>                  says the knight as you account him.
<ce>                    The contract has been fulfilled.
