QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                   %pcf, I have an important mission
<ce>               that will require the utmost discretion.
<ce>                I can't tell you more unless you agree
<ce>                     to help me. What do you say?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                %oth, I had expected much more of you.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               An old friend of mine is in grave danger,
<ce>                and needs an escort who is handy with a
<ce>                blade and can keep a secret. Naturally,
<ce>                    I thought of you. _target_ will
<ce>              meet you at 10:00 tonight at _targethouse_.
<ce>                %g will tell you more when you arrive.
<ce>              I would come with you, but since I am known
<ce>                as %g3 friend, I might lead %g3 enemies
<ce>                 to %g2. Watch your back on this one.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                We have nothing more to discuss, %pcn.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            You alerted me to a grave threat to the realm.
<ce>              Please accept my sincere thanks as well as
<ce>                          this _reward_ gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>      _enemy_ has been recruiting mercenaries at ___stronghold_.
<ce>                          I wonder what for?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>      Did you hear about that ambush in __targethouse_? An agent
<ce>                 of the Queen of Sentinel was killed.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>    It seems that one of the court nobles of Sentinel was plotting
<ce>     against the throne, but the Queen found out and destroyed his
<ce>                      fortress at ___stronghold_.
                                     <--->
<ce>       _ruler_'s forces attacked ___stronghold_, but I hear that
<ce>        the target of the whole attack, a _traitor_, got away.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce> I hear you got through to _ruler_, although _target_ bought the farm.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>   What happened with that mission to escort  _target_  to  _ruler_?

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of the __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ asked me
 to meet _target_ at
 _targethouse_ at 10:00
 tonight. I know nothing else
 except that _target_ is
 in danger from powerful enemies.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 I met with _target_, and
 we are proceeding to Sentinel.

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 I was ambushed leaving _targethouse_,
 and _target_ was killed. Before
 %g died, however, %g slipped me a letter
 exposing _traitor_, a member of
 _ruler_'s court in Sentinel,
 as a traitor. _target_'s dying
 wish was that I deliver the letter
 to _ruler_. She will want
 to see this before =patsy_ days have passed.

Message:  1023
%qdt:
 I showed _ruler_ the treasonous
 letter, but _traitor_ had
 already fled to his fortress
 of ___stronghold_.
 The Queen asked me to infiltrate
 the fortress and capture or kill
 _traitor_. She gave me =gettraitor_
 days to accomplish this mission
 and return to Sentinel.

Message:  1030
Dear %pcn,
 
 Change of plans. _questgiver_
 had to leave town quickly, and asked
 me to meet you in _tavern_.
 Please come at once. The matter
 is extremely urgent.
 
<ce>                                _enemy_

Message:  1031
My dear _enemy_,
 
 I am pleased to hear of your progress
 in training my forces at ___stronghold_.
 I will send more money as soon as I can
 raise it, as you will need to hire more
 troops if we hope to defeat _ruler_.
 You are surely correct that going into open
 battle against her is a lost cause, but I believe
 that even for a coup de main against the
 Castle itself, we will need more men.
 
 We can discuss this matter further in
 person when I arrive at ___stronghold_
 in a few weeks. If you need to reach me
 in the meantime, I am staying in the Palace
 at __palace_. If all goes well, we may soon
 have a new ally. Once the situation here
 is proceeding smoothly again, I must return
 to Sentinel to pay my respects (perhaps my
 "final respects"!) to our dear Queen. Her
 agents have been dogging my steps lately,
 so I shall allay her suspicions by a show of
 fawning subservience which she so appreciates.
 
 Keep me informed of your progress.
 
<ce>                            Most sincerely,
<ce>                                    
<ce>                              _traitor_,
<ce>                               __palace_

Message:  1032
<ce>                 A small child of indeterminate gender
<ce>                    hands you a note, and runs away
<ce>                  before you have a chance to react.

Message:  1040
<ce>                         %pcn, right? I'm glad
<ce>                     I managed to contact you. Did
<ce>                      _questgiver_ tell you much
<ce>                   about what was going on? I didn't
<ce>                   think so. Suffice it to say that
<ce>                    the Necromancers are involved.
<ce>                Dangerous people to cross, indeed. But,
<ce>                 I have an _amulet_ for you which will
<ce>                warn you if agents of the Necromancers
<ce>                   are nearby. Should come in handy.
<ce>                     Keep a wary eye out, friend.

Message:  1041
<ce>                      You are %pcn? _questgiver_
<ce>                  described you well. I am _target_.
<ce>                 We must proceed to Sentinel at once.
<ce>                  I can tell you no more, except that
<ce>                     the enemies of _ruler_ would
<ce>                         give much to stop us.

Message:  1042
<ce>                     _target_ gasps, and you turn
<ce>               to see a feathered shaft protruding from
<ce>                 %g3 chest. As %g sinks to %g3 knees,
<ce>            %g slips a letter into your hand, and murmurs,
<ce>                                    
<ce>                 "_traitor_ is a traitor to Sentinel.
<ce>                    You must get this to _ruler_."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                           _target_ is dead.

Message:  1043
<ce>                You are suddenly surrounded by a bright
<ce>                 glow. Looking down, you see that the
<ce>                    light is coming from the amulet
<ce>                     _enemy_ gave you. The ground
<ce>                   seems to open beneath your feet,
<ce>                       and darkness engulfs you.

Message:  1050
<ce>                   Do you give the treasonous letter
<ce>                              to _ruler_?

Message:  1051
<ce>                 "Yes? What's this letter? Dear %god,
<ce>                  _traitor_ is plotting against me?!
<ce>                Guards! Search the Castle for _traitor_
<ce>                     and bring him to me at once."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                Several guards run from the room. A few
<ce>             minutes later one returns. With a salute, he
<ce>            reports that _traitor_ is nowhere to be found.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                         _ruler_ turns to you:
<ce>                                    
<ce>              "He must have been alerted that his treason
<ce>               was about to be uncovered. Most likely he
<ce>                 has retired to this ___stronghold_ he
<ce>           refers to in his letter. Under the circumstances,
<ce>           I would prefer to avoid a direct attack. You are
<ce>          familiar with the area, yes? Would you perform one
<ce>        more service for me and bring this traitor to justice?"

Message:  1052
<ce>                %pcn, you are proving most loyal to the
<ce>           throne of Sentinel. I will wait =gettraitor_ days
<ce>                before assaulting _traitor_'s fortress.
<ce>             I hereby proclaim _traitor_ outlaw -- capture
<ce>               him if you can, but kill him if you must.

Message:  1053
<ce>                Very well. I will deal with him myself.

Message:  1054
<ce>                _ruler_ opens the letter and reads it.
<ce>                     Her face darkens with anger.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                        "There can be no doubt.
<ce>                         This is his personal
<ce>                          seal and signature.
<ce>                           Guards! Go to the
<ce>                         Great Hall and seize
<ce>                          _traitor_ at once,
<ce>                    and throw him in the dungeon."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                           She turns to you.

Message:  1055
<ce>                 So be it. _traitor_ chose his course,
<ce>               and paid the consequences, thanks to you.
<ce>                  Here is an enchanted _queenreward_
<ce>                     for your service to Sentinel.

Message:  1056
<ce>                  %oth! _traitor_ is a slippery one,
<ce>                  indeed. Well, I will track him down
<ce>                  eventually, never fear. Sentinel's
<ce>                  justice will pursue him wherever he
<ce>                   may hide. His associates have all
<ce>                  been arrested or fled the realm, so
<ce>                 _traitor_ no longer poses any threat,
<ce>                     at least. %pcn, please accept
<ce>                     this enchanted _queenreward_
<ce>                     for your service to Sentinel.

Message:  1060
<ce>            Do you give the treasonous letter to _traitor_?

Message:  1061
<ce>              I seem to have misjudged you, %pcn. Perhaps
<ce>             we can be friends after all. Here, take this
<ce>                  _traitorreward_ for your troubles.

Message:  1062
<ce>                 _traitor_ looks at you intently. The
<ce>               color drains from his face as he realizes
<ce>                who you are, and before anyone can stop
<ce>                 him he turns and bolts for the door.

Message:  1070
<ce>                    %ra dog, you will pay for your
<ce>                   meddling in _traitor_'s affairs.

Message:  1071
<ce>                   Surrender and be dragged through
<ce>                  the streets of Sentinel as a public
<ce>                           spectacle? Never!

Message:  1072
<ce>                          _traitor_ is dead.

Message:  1073
<ce>                   _traitor_ throws down his weapon.
<ce>                   Thinking he is surrendering, you
<ce>                   pause in your attack, but instead
<ce>                    he twists a ring on his finger.
<ce>                   As _traitor_ disappears in a haze
<ce>                 of light, you faintly hear him shout,
<ce>                                    
<ce>                       "Tell that bitch that she
<ce>                     hasn't seen the last of me!"
