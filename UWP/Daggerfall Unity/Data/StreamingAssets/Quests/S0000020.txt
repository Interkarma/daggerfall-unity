<ce>               So Morgiah says Gortwog has the emperor's
<ce>               letter. Very interesting. I think I have a
<ce>              way to get Gortwog to turn over that letter.
<ce>                 Are you willing to brave the depths of
<ce>                    Orsinium to try to retrieve it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 You are obviously not as loyal to the
<ce>                     empire as I thought. Be gone.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Gortwog wants very badly to be recognized
<ce>               by the empire. It would mean the beginning
<ce>                of peace between the orcs and the other
<ce>              races of the empire. Present this letter to
<ce>                Gortwog. Hopefully it will persuade him
<ce>                             to cooperate.

 Mynisera, Queen Mother to King Gothryd
 of Daggerfall, has asked me to retrieve
 the stolen letter sent to her by the
 emperor. I have to go to the hall of
 Orsinium in Orsinium and give Gortwog,
 the orc warlord, a letter from her.

Message:  1015
So, Mynisera seeks to sweet talk me.
 Bah! Her letter is of no value to me
 anymore. She may have it. However, my
 people may not be so lenient toward a
 %ra wandering the halls of Orsinium.
 If you can survive my realm and find
 the letter, you may take it back to
 her. I will also consider you to be
 a worthy %ra.

Message:  1020
Lord Gortwog,
 King of Orcs,
 Warlord of the Subterranean Realms
 
    Hail and long life King Gortwog. Long
 have you and the Orcish people sought
 formal recognition by the empire. My dead
 husband King Lysandus supported your claim
 to sovereign rule. I would now help you in
 your cause. Sadly, a minor missive from
 the emperor has been misplaced. For me to
 truly hold the trust and ear of Emperor
 Uriel Septim, I need to reclaim this note.
 Should you be able to place in my servant's
 hand this trifling letter, I would be far
 better able to forward your claim to the
 emperor and his court.
 
 The Dowager Mynisera,
 Queen Mother to King Gothryd of Daggerfall

Message:  1021
Queen Mynisera,
 
    I have grave news. The Totem of Tiber
 Septim has been found. You know what this
 means. The power behind Tiber Septim could
 be unleashed upon Tamriel again. Rumor has it
 that Lord Woodborne, a minor lord of Wayrest,
 has possession of it. He will doubtless
 "lose" it soon. You must persuade him to turn
 it over to you or Lady Brisienna. The court of
 Wayrest has no love of King Lysandus, but you
 still have influence there. I am asking you to
 use it on my behalf.
 
 Uriel Septim
 Emperor of Tamriel

Message:  1030
<ce>                    %pcf, this letter is dangerous.
 Gortwog had undoubtedly sold copies of it
 to everyone from Wayrest to the Underking.
 After all, if the powers of the Iliac Bay
 become embroiled in war over the Totem, he
 stands to gain quite a lot.
 
 Go now. You have done your job. I am sure
 the Totem will find its way into your life
 somehow. You seem to have a knack for such
 things. Just remember, the only safe master
 of the Totem is the emperor.

Message:  1040
<ce>               You still don't know where the Emperor's
<ce>                letter is. Come back when you know that.
