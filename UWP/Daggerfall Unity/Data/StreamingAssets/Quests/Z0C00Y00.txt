QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              I might have known it would be you. I ought
<ce>            to never answer these summonings. Well, perhaps
<ce>               it is natural for a worm to want to evolve
<ce>                  into a wasp. Very well, %pcf, I will
<ce>             give you power, but you must do something for
<ce>               me first. I need someone to assassinate a
<ce>              certain troublesome minor noble. Can I rely
<ce>                            on you for that?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               That is just as well. I have better uses
<ce>                 for my time than building a power base
<ce>                   for ungrateful, lazy guttersnipes.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Well, that's something, anyhow. You can find
<ce>                     this irksome official _enemy_
<ce>              in __palace_, snug and secure in his palace,
<ce>                as he believes. I don't know how you're
<ce>             going to gain entry, but perhaps you will come
<ce>             up with an idea. Perhaps. If you don't manage
<ce>                  to kill yourself, go to ___qgfriend_
<ce>              and I'll arrange for a servant to bring you
<ce>                your new power source, the _artifact_. I
<ce>                   will ask my servant _qgfriend_ to
<ce>           wait for you for =1stparton_ days at __qgfriend_.
<ce>                 Do not, please, be late. That is all.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     No, no, no, no! You kill the
<ce>                          knight in __palace_
<ce>                    first, then you come to see me!
<ce>                        %oth, Mephala was right.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Good day, %pcf, I'm _qgfriend_.
<ce>            Mephala told me that you might show up, but she
<ce>             did cast some doubts about the chances of you
<ce>                 surviving the encounter with _enemy_.
<ce>           Well, it's a good thing I brought the Blade, then,
<ce>              isn't it? Sorry if you got a bad talking to
<ce>                       from Mephala. With _enemy_
<ce>               dead, she should be in a lot better mood.
<ce>                    And for that alone, I thank you.

--removed odd <---> in 1004.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_enemy_ says %g can find %g3 way to the headquarters of the Dark Brotherhood.
<--->
The Dark Brotherhood must be terrified with _enemy_ working against them.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The Dark Brotherhood sent someone to get _enemy_, but they couldn't kill %g2!
<--->
After that failed assassination attempt, _enemy_ has moved out of __palace_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_enemy_ must have been too close to finding the location of Nightside Asylum.
<--->
I guess the Dark Brotherhood heard about _enemy_ and %g3 ambitions.

Message:  1011
_qgfriend_ is that snobby =qgfriend_ slumming in __qgfriend_, %di of here.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is the name of that =qgfriend_ %di of here in __qgfriend_.

Message:  1012
_qgfriend_ is one of Mephala's agents in %reg, operating out of __qgfriend_.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is a pawn of Mephala; %g's a =qgfriend_ at __qgfriend_.

Message:  1013
Mephala is the Daedra Regent of Murder and Patroness of the Dark Brotherhood.
<--->
Mephala is one of the Princes of Oblivion whose sphere is Murder.

Message:  1014
<ce> The _artifact_ is an artifact of vampiric power, draining its victim
 of life, even as it feeds its owner.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I have made a contract with one of the Daedra
 Princes, Mephala -- I will slay an official
 named _enemy_ and she will give me
 an artifact called the _artifact_. Her contact
 _qgfriend_ will wait for me for =1stparton_
 days in __qgfriend_ of ___qgfriend_.
 The only other complication is that Mephala tells me
 that _enemy_ lives in the palace
 at __palace_. Could be difficult to
 get to %g2.

Message:  1030
<ce>                       Mephala would be proud--
<ce>                         _enemy_ is dead.  Time
<ce>                          to make your escape.

Message:  1040
<ce>              Who are you and what are you doing in here?

Message:  1041
<ce>           You sneaking assassins are all the same.  That's
<ce>           why I decided to get myself some real protection.
<ce>               =bodyguard_!  Wake up, you big oaf.  Kill!
