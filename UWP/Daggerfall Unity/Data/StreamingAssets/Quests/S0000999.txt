%qdt:
 I am on a mission from the emperor to investigate
 the shade of King Lysandus. His spirit has been
 haunting the city of Daggerfall. The emperor
 himself has charged me with the duty of laying
 his ghost to rest.
    There is also the minor matter of a letter
 he sent to the Queen of Daggerfall. If I should
 find out what happened to the letter, he would be
 most appreciative.
    Before landing in Daggerfall, a sudden storm
 capsized the ship. I barely made it into this cave.

%qdt:
 I met with Lady Brisienna in a tavern room. She
 told me that the three major powers of the Iliac
 bay are Daggerfall, Wayrest, and Sentinel. If I
 am to investigate the mystery of Lysandus' ghost,
 I should start by speaking with the royal families
 of these fiefdoms.

<ce>       You are approached by a young page who smiles in recognition
<ce>        and does not ask your name before he hands you a letter
<ce>         addressed to you. To all of your questions, he merely
<ce>                responds with a blank look and a smile.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A letter is pressed into your hand. You spin
<ce>            to see who gave it to you. You catch a glimpse
<ce>                of livery that vanishes into the crowd.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A page steps forward saying "Letter for you
<ce>                     %pcn," and hands you a note.
                                     <--->
<ce>              A courier steps up to you with a letter in
<ce>               hand. "I was told to give this letter to
<ce>                someone fitting your description," says
<ce>               the courier. As you take it, the courier
<ce>                     turns and walks quickly away.
                                     <--->
<ce>               Reaching into your pack for something to
<ce>             eat, you spy a note. It wasn't there before.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A redfaced courier startles you with a cry of
<ce>                  "Letter for %pcn! Hey that must be
<ce>                 you. Here, take this. Gotta go. Other
<ce>                        deliveries to be made.

Message:  1031
<ce>                        %pcn, I have a special
<ce>              task in mind for you. However, to be blunt
<ce>             you have yet to prove yourself to me. I don't
<ce>               know if I can trust you yet. I will watch
<ce>            your actions and how you conduct yourself with
<ce>             other members of my court and my family. That
<ce>            will tell me if you have the proper character.
                                     <--->
<ce>              Your bravery and skill are beyond reproach.
<ce>             If I felt I could trust you, I would send you
<ce>            on a particularly sensative mission. Come back
<ce>             and visit me when you shown I can trust you.

Message:  1032
<ce>                      %pcn, I have a special task
<ce>            that would be perfect for you. However, I would
<ce>            just be signing your death warrant if I were to
<ce>            give it to you now. When you are more skillful
<ce>              return to me and I may give it to you then.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   Its really too bad, %pcf. I have
<ce>             a special assignment that requires someone I
<ce>            trust, such as yourself. However, it also needs
<ce>             someone of greater skill in order to survive.
<ce>             Come back and visit me when you have improved
<ce>                        your skills some more.

Message:  1033
<ce>                      %pcn, You might be just the
<ce>               person ta help me. But I don't trusts ya
<ce>                well nuff yet. If I hears that you are
<ce>                 a standup %ra, maybe you should come
<ce>                        back and ask me again.

Message:  1034
<ce>                    I could sure use yer help %pcn.
<ce>               But you just ain't tough enough ta handle
<ce>              what I gotta have done. You get better and
<ce>                           then come see me.

Message:  1035
<ce>                I have delicate matters that might need
<ce>               your touch. First you must prove yourself
<ce>               worthy. Return to me when you have earned
<ce>                  the trust to deserve my patronage.

Message:  1036
<ce>              You are trustworthy, that I know. However,
<ce>              to be blunt, you are unskilled. Should you
<ce>               gain greater skill and become a deadlier
<ce>               opponent, I think I could give some very
<ce>                           interesting work.

Message:  1040
%pcn,
 
    Greetings and salutations. I hope your trip
 was uneventful. They say that you are keenly
 interested in the haunting of Daggerfall. My
 father and King Lysandus were somewhat close.
 Should you come visit me, I might be able to shed
 some light upon recent events involving Lysandus.
 
 Prince Lhotun,
 Castle Sentinel

Message:  1041
Dear %pcf,
 
    My eyes and ears abroad say that you are
 interested in the fate of a certain letter.
 Any emperor should not be so careless, nor should
 a queen. You really should come visit me in
 Castle Wayrest. I have some most interesting
 tidbits that I am sure you would enjoy hearing.
