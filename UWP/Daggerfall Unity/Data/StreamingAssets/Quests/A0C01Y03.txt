<ce>                       I am _qgiver_, and I need
<ce>                the services of a hunter of men. I am in
<ce>                      love with _spouse_. Alas, %g
<ce>             refuses to marry unless I prove my worthiness
<ce>                    by answering a riddle %g3 mentor
<ce>                 _hermit_ left behind when %g vanished.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                The only person who might help you find
<ce>                         _hermit_ is _spouse_.

<ce>              Take these flowers. They are %g3 favorites.
<ce>                 They may gain you some favor with %g2.
<ce>                    Here is a letter with _hermit_'s
<ce>               riddle inscribed upon it. If you have not
<ce>                returned in three months, I will assume

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  _qgiver_ rips open the letter from
<ce>                  _hermit_. "Kindness! Of course. Now
<ce>                  I understand why _spouse_ sent me on
<ce>               this quest. It is not enough to love %g2,
<ce>                I have to show %g2 kindness as well. You
<ce>                   have been most helpful, %pcf. Here
<ce>                      is the gold I promised you."

<ce>                   %g has been trying to get _spouse_
<ce>                to accept a marriage proposal for ages.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]

<ce>                      ___spouse_ married. _qgiver_
<ce>                 will be heartbroken when %g finds out.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                        Good news! _spouse_ and
<ce>                    _qgiver_ were married recently.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  Anything for the %ra that found the
<ce>                     answer to my riddle. _spouse_
<ce>                      and I are married, you know.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>              You are the %ra that was unable to find the
<ce>              answer to the hermit's riddle. I have no use
<ce>                           for failed heroes.

%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_
 asked me to find _hermit_.
 Supposedly, _hermit_ has the
 answer to a riddle. The only clue
 I have is that %g once worked with
 _spouse_ in ___spouse_.

Message:  1011
<ce>               The _flowers_ were not really necessary.
<ce>                    _hermit_ left to study under the
<ce>                      famous teacher _teacher_ in
<ce>                    __school_. If you give %g2 this
<ce>                 book, %g may look upon you favorably.

Message:  1012
<ce>                    _hermit_ asked me not to reveal
<ce>                 %g3 whereabouts to strangers. However,
<ce>                      since you bring _book_ from
<ce>                   _spouse_, you are clearly not just
<ce>                    some stranger. _hermit_ secluded
<ce>                  %g2self in a dungeon to study arcane
<ce>                  lore. I have marked its location on
<ce>                       your map. Good luck, %pcn.

Message:  1013
<ce>                  I hate being bothered! If the only
<ce>                  way to get you to leave me alone is
<ce>                 to give you the answer to that stupid
<ce>                  riddle, then here, take it. Now get
<ce>                   out of here before I summon a fire
<ce>                      daedra to show you the way.

Message:  1014
Speak not of love or hate, but tell
 me this: what gift can you give to
 me that I can never buy for myself?
