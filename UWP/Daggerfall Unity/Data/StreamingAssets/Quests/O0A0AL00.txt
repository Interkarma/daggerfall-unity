<ce>                Another initiate. Sometimes I wonder if
<ce>              the guild can hold them all. Ah, I see they
<ce>               sent you after a mage's _clothing_. It's a
<ce>                 popular choice of late. You are now a
<ce>               member of the Thieves Guild. Whenever you
<ce>              enter a town, you will know if there are any
<ce>               guild buildings there. Unfortunately guild
<ce>                  rules say I have to pay you for this
<ce>               worthless piece of trash because you stole
<ce>                    it in the service of the guild.
<ce>                          Here's a gold piece.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                                    
<ce>              Oh, I almost forgot. You are also entitled
<ce>             to a dungeon map. Here, let me show you where
<ce>                        ___dungeon_ is on yours.

I just had a three hour conversation about the weather.

The weather is pretty usual for this time of year.
<--->
It seems a trifle coolish in %cn for this time of year.
<--->
It sure is a lot warmer today than this time last year.
<--->
My great aunt is going to a specialist across the Bay.

It's always funny what time it gets dark around here.

We should erect a war statue around here.

The kids these days with their magic. %oth, I don't know.
<--->
I had the weirdest dream last night.

<--->
%jok Can you explain that to me?

The legal system in %reg has its good points and bad ones.

%qdt:
 I was handed a note by a beggar.
 The Thieves Guild has targeted me for 'unapproved'
 criminal activity. I must either join them or become
 their enemy.

<ce>                      A one-eyed beggar hands you
<ce>                       a letter. "A woman in gray
<ce>                     paid me to give this to you."
<ce>                                he says.

<ce>                     As you pick up the _clothing_
<ce>                      you hear the soft rustle of
<ce>                        paper. A note is tucked
<ce>                         inside the _clothing_.

Message:  1024
%pcn,
    You are a thief. Do not
 try to deny it, you have
 been seen in the act. There
 is honor among thieves.
 Either join the guild or
 face the consequences. Steal
 the _clothing_ from
 _mansion_
 in ___mansion_
 if you desire to join us.
 You have =traveltime_ days.

Message:  1030
<ce>                  Thief! I'll teach you to steal from
<ce>                   a wizard. It will be a lesson you
<ce>                           won't soon forget!
