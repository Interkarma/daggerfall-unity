<ce>               Our order demands retribution on a former
<ce>                member who has turned traitor. Will you
<ce>                  be the strong arm of our fury, %pcf?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  The Goddess has spoken to us in our
<ce>                 auguries, and she demands the blood of
<ce>                 the foul villain who has profaned her
<ce>                  name. Help us to appease our angered
<ce>                           mistress Kynareth.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 An ignoble reply. I expected better.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Very good. The traitor is a killer
<ce>                   who has taken refuge in ___mondun_
<ce>                  to the %di. If you have not returned
<ce>                 in =queston_ days, your honor will be
<ce>               forfeit and another will take your place.
<ce>                     Do not fail us in this, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  The traitor is not dead. Do not try
<ce>                       to convince me otherwise.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Well done. You have reason to be proud.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That skulker ran off to ___mondun_ like the hounds of hell were behind him.
<--->
<ce>             _qgiver_ can't just let the shiftless bum go
<ce>                after what %g did to the Kynaran Order.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The traitor is apparently tougher than _qgiver_ thought. What an escape.
<--->
The renegade has moved north I hear, but the memory still plagues the order.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The traitor's story just proves it. You don't play around with the Kynaran Order.
<--->
I always thought the Order would be more merciful to that dolt.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Well, you slew that traitor for the Order. The least I can do is say hello.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You let that traitor go. I have nothing to say to you.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 The Kynaran Order in ___qgiver_
 has sent me to find and slay a traitor
 to the Order in a hideout,
 ___mondun_. I have
 =queston_ days to accomplish this.

Message:  1020
<ce>                    "So...the Kynaran Order...sent
<ce>                    you to kill...me. Tell them...I
<ce>                           spit on their..."
<ce>                          The traitor is dead.
