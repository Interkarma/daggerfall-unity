Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I have received a mysterious summons
 to _tavern_ in __tavern_
 in ____tavern_, I believe by my friend _rebel_.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 I have agreed to help _rebel_
 "liberate" a map to ___itemdung_
 from the Mages Guild of __magesguild_.

Message:  1022
%qdt:
 We have retrieved the map.  _rebel_
 has another matter to attend to, so
 I will meet him back in _tavern_
 in =keytime_ days.

Message:  1023
%qdt:
 We have retrieved the map.  I have
 offered to go to ___keydung_
 to find a special _key_ which we
 need to enter ___itemdung_.
 I will meet _rebel_ back in
 _tavern_ in =keytime_ days.

Message:  1030
<ce>                    A tattered map to ___itemdung_.

Message:  1040
<ce>               It was good of you to come.  I have a new
<ce>             project that I think you might be interested
<ce>               in.  It will involve a little raid on our
<ce>                 friends at the Mages Guild, however.
<ce>                           What do you say?

Message:  1041
<ce>                Have it your way.  I thought you and I
<ce>                       were friends, that's all.

Message:  1042
<ce>             I knew you couldn't resist!  Here's the plan.
<ce>             For some time now, I have been searching for
<ce>                the location of ___itemdung_, reputedly
<ce>           the resting place of a hoard of magical objects,
<ce>              including one _item_ that I need for my own
<ce>              purposes -- another story for another time.
<ce>             The issue at hand is that I have learned that
<ce>               the Mages Guild of __magesguild_ has come
<ce>               into possession of a map to ___itemdung_.
<ce>           I still have a few friends in the Guild, despite
<ce>             the official ban against me... The Guild has
<ce>             no idea what they have, so it is up to us to
<ce>              liberate the map so that it can be used to
<ce>                          its full potential.

Message:  1043
<ce>                         Yes, this is the map!

Message:  1044
<ce>                       _rebel_ raises his staff.
<ce>           "Ladies, gentlemen, we really must be going now."
<ce>               A sphere of light bursts from the staff,
<ce>                     blinding you for an instant.

QuestTimeLapse:  [1045]
<ce>           I think it would be best to separate for the time
<ce>           being, to let this hornet's nest calm down a bit.
<ce>           I have one more matter to attend to before we can
<ce>                   enter ___itemdung_ ... unless you
<ce>                    would like to handle it for me?

Message:  1046
<ce>          Very well.  ___itemdung_ cannot be entered without
<ce>          the key, a _key_ which I have learned is somewhere
<ce>           in ___keydung_.  Once you get the _key_, meet me
<ce>           in _tavern_ in __tavern_, say, in =keytime_ days.

Message:  1047
<ce>            No matter.  I will need, say, =keytime_ days to
<ce>             take care of this business.  I will meet you
<ce>                    back in __tavern_, at _tavern_,
<ce>                    when I have acquired the key to
<ce>                       ___itemdung_.  Good luck!

Message:  1050
<ce>           This must be the _key_, the key to ___itemdung_.

Message:  1051
<ce>          With this _key_ in our possession, we are ready to
<ce>               brave ___itemdung_.  Lead on, my friend!

Message:  1052
<ce>                         A hollow voice booms,
<ce>                   "Intruders are not welcome here!"

Message:  1053
<ce>              You are too late, _rebel_!  It was a simple
<ce>              matter to follow you to ___itemdung_, once
<ce>              you had found the _key_ for me.  The _item_
<ce>                     is now mine, and mine alone!

Message:  1054
<ce>             "Well, friend %pcf, an enjoyable little jaunt
<ce>             eh?  I'll take the _item_ and be on my way."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                  Do you give the _item_ to _rebel_?

Message:  1055
<ce>                           Until next time!

Message:  1056
<ce>                     So, your true colors at last.
<ce>                   I only asked for one small thing,
<ce>                       yet your greed apparently
<ce>                           knows no bounds.

Message:  1070
<ce>                   A shadow flits overhead.  A raven
<ce>                  circles, cawing out harshly before
<ce>                      disappearing into the west:
<ce>                                    
<ce>                          "No time!  No time!
<ce>                               _tavern_,
<ce>                               __tavern_
<ce>                             ____tavern_!"

Message:  1071
<ce>                          %pcf, are you lost?
<ce>                         I'm afraid I'll have
<ce>                           to leave you now.
