QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  %pcf, always a pleasure to see you,
<ce>             my dear friend, especially when I need help.
<ce>                    I need to get this _item_ to my
<ce>                   contact in ___contact_, but I've
<ce>             received word that a vampiric tribe does not
<ce>              want my courier to get through. You're the
<ce>               only person I can think of who might get
<ce>                       it through. Will you try?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Really? Too busy, perhaps. That is a shame.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Ah, marvelous. Here's the _item_.
<ce>                    Now, _contact_ needs to have it
<ce>                   in __contact_ in =queston_ days.
<ce>                   Look for a =contact_.  You can't
<ce>            miss %g2.  And don't get yourself killed in the
<ce>                   process. Good luck and thank you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 %pcf, you are wasting precious time.
<ce>                    Get on the road to ___contact_
<ce>                             immediately.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Ah, good to see you %pcf. And the
<ce>              _item_ too. Excellent. Those nightstalkers
<ce>            were wise to try to keep this out of my hands.
<ce>                Here's a little gold for your trouble.
<ce>                        Take care of yourself.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
They're doing some research into some vampiric matters in __contact_, I hear.
<--->
_contact_, one of the greatest of the vampire hunters, has joined __contact_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Someone found a very lovely _item_ around here recently.
<--->
I hear _questgiver_ is mad as hell at some %ra adventurer.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
It seems safer to walk the streets in %reg I've noticed.
<--->
Sure vampire attacks are becoming rarer. But it's not time to get cocky yet.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I guess the bloodsuckers learned their lesson, eh, %pcf? What can I do for you?
<--->
I understand that the delivery went through. Of course, no surprise to me.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  The vampires proved too much, %pcf?
<ce>              Don't feel bad -- they are a powerful lot.
<ce>                   Now is not a good time to speak.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ wants
 me to deliver a particular _item_ to
 %g3 contact in ___contact_, a shaman
 named _contact_ at __contact_.
 The local vampires apparently do not want
 me to complete the delivery, but I need to
 get the _item_ to ___contact_ within =queston_
 days or my reward is forfeit.

Message:  1011
<ce>                   So, you must be the doughty %pcn.
<ce>                  Welcome to my humble abode.  When I
<ce>                  heard that =vampleader_'s attack on
<ce>                  you failed, I wondered if you might
<ce>                look me up.  Let me introduce myself --
<ce>                I am _vampire_ of ==vampire_, the most
<ce>                 ancient and respected of the vampire
<ce>                   bloodlines.  Now, I realize that
<ce>                 you have agreed to deliver a certain
<ce>                 _item_ to that notorious executioner
<ce>                   _contact_.  ==vampire_ would very
<ce>                 much prefer if you made that delivery
<ce>             to me instead.  Purely a semantic difference,
<ce>               don't you agree?  Especially since we are
<ce>               willing to pay you _vampreward_ gold plus
<ce>                a magical _vampitem_ as a bonus.  What
<ce>                do you say to that most generous offer?

Message:  1012
<ce>              Marvelous. The up and coming %ra adventurer
<ce>            makes a wise change of allegiance. _questgiver_
<ce>            won't be pleased, but %g had best learn to love
<ce>           disappointment.  It has been a distinct pleasure
<ce>           doing business with you.  Perhaps you and I will
<ce>              meet again on a more...intimate...occasion.

Message:  1013
<ce>               Your loyalty to _questgiver_ is touching,
<ce>                 but quite unfortunate for both of us.
<ce>                You can let yourself out, %pcf.  Oh, by
<ce>              the way, don't sleep too soundly at night.
<ce>                 ==vampire_ always settle their debts.

Message:  1015
_contact_ has been leading the crusade to drive the vampires out of %reg.
<--->
<ce>Sometimes I wonder if all the people _contact_ has burned at the stake
<ce> were really vampires.  It's hard to believe there are so many around.

Message:  1030
<ce>                  The parchment shows the location of
<ce>              Kykos Coven in Dak'fron, whatever that is.
<ce>                 You quickly mark it down on your map.

Message:  1040
=vampleader_,
 
 That thrice-damned _questgiver_ has finally
 acquired the _item_ %g has been looking for,
 and is sending it over to _contact_.
 You know as well as I that ==vampire_
 cannot allow it to arrive.  _questgiver_
 is expecting us to try to stop %g2, so %g is looking
 for a %ra named %pcn to act as courier.
 Do not underestimate this one -- %pcf has
 quite a reputation.  Bring the _item_ to me at
 once -- I will wait for you at _vamphouse_ in
 __vamphouse_.
 
                            Yours in death,
 
                            _vampire_
