<ce>                           Well done, %pcn.
<ce>                     _npc_ was stricken with sudden
<ce>              heart failure. Poor bastard. You have shown
<ce>               you can kill with care and not just with a
<ce>               bared blade. You are now a full member of
<ce>               the Dark Brotherhood. Anytime you enter a
<ce>               town, you will know if there are any guild
<ce>                  buildings there. It is customary for
<ce>               the novice to receive payment of a single
<ce>               gold coin for %pg3 first sanctioned death.
<ce>                             Here is yours.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_npc_ ought to watch %g3 step. %g has a number of enemies.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
It is unwise to disregard the Dark Brotherhood. Unwise and fatal.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Poor _npc_. I guess %g made too many enemies. One too many.
<--->
The wine in _npc_'s decanter must've gone bad. Wine does that.

%qdt:
 I had a secret meeting with
 _apothecary_, a member of the
 Dark Brotherhood, the guild of
 assassins, in ___apothecary_.
 I was given a vial of _poison_
 to secretly put into the wine of
 _npc_ of _mansion_,
 in __mansion_.  According to
 _apothecary_, if I then go see
 _darkbmember_ in ___darkbmember_,
 I will become a member of the Dark
 Brotherhood. I have =traveltime_ days to
 reach him, or the Brotherhood will
 assume I have failed in my quest.

<ce>                     A young street urchin presses
<ce>                      a letter into your hand. As
<ce>                      you attempt to question him,
<ce>                     it becomes obvious that he is
<ce>                       both deaf and mute. With a
<ce>                      wave of frustration you send
<ce>                            him on his way.

<ce>                      You feel a letter slip into
<ce>                      your hand and hear the sound
<ce>                     of footsteps scampering away.
<ce>                       There is no other sign of
<ce>                        the mysterious courier.

 I was handed a mysterious letter
 by a street urchin. I dare not copy
 its contents into this journal.

<ce>                        You have failed, %pcn.
<ce>                           _npc_ still lives.
<ce>                        It is a guild rule that
<ce>                        someone must die once a
<ce>                       contract is accepted. You
<ce>                     must take the place of _npc_.

Message:  1015
<ce>                         Ah, you must be %pcn.
<ce>              The Dark Brotherhood has been watching you.
<ce>               You have proven you can kill with a blade.
<ce>                The Brotherhood does not tolerate rogue
<ce>               assassins. You must either join us, or be
<ce>                 marked for death. The Brotherhood will
<ce>               initiate you as a full member if you take
<ce>                   this _poison_ and place it in the
<ce>                       wine decanter of _npc_ in
<ce>                        _mansion_ of __mansion_.
<ce>               You have =traveltime_ days to do this and
<ce>                       report to _darkbmember_ in
<ce>                     ___darkbmember_. The blessings
<ce>                       of Mephala upon you, %pcn.

Message:  1019
<ce>                        The _poison_ clouds the
<ce>                       wine but briefly. In a few
<ce>                        seconds the drink looks
<ce>                       normal again. Now all you
<ce>                       have to do is put it back.

    The Dark Brotherhood has been watching
 you. You have slain without sanction several
 times. You must now join us, or be counted
 as our foe. Travel to ___apo_
 in ____apo_ and see _apothecary_,
 who will give you further instructions.
 We give you =S.01_ days.
 
<ce>                               A Brother
