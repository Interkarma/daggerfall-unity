QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              A certain merchant needs to have a monster,
<ce>               a gargoyle to be precise, dispatched. The
<ce>               pay is a modest _gold_ gold pieces. Can I
<ce>                     have your help in this matter?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Hmmm. Not the brave, heroic
<ce>                             sort I guess.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               It seems this merchant hired a wizard to
<ce>                build him a grand mansion. Then the poor
<ce>               fool tried to cheat the mage of his wages.
<ce>               The wizard grew angry and animated one of
<ce>                the stone gargoyles on the new mansion.
<ce>                   It has been attacking the merchant
<ce>                   ceaselessly. Go out to ___dungeon_
<ce>                     and kill the thing. You've got
<ce>                   =2dung_ days to complete the task.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        Hail to the hero, %pcn!
<ce>                     Well done! This paltry fee of
<ce>                    _gold_ is hardly a worthy reward
<ce>                            for such a deed.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                  The Mages Guild has refused to kill
<ce>                that rampaging gargoyle. They claim its
<ce>                    not their fault. Lazy bastards.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                 Some merchant was killed recently. I
<ce>                 hear that a gargoyle was seen hovering
<ce>                             over his body.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                The Fighters Guild took out a gargoyle.
<ce>                  Those guys are good to have around.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                   Well done with the gargoyle %pcn.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  That gargoyle killed the merchant.
<ce>                  You should never have taken the job.
<ce>                    Now you've made yourself and the
<ce>                            guild look bad.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
On %qdt,
 The Fighters Guild of ___qgiver_
 charged me with the duty of destroying a
 gargoyle that lairs in ___dungeon_.
 I have =2dung_ days to finish the task.

Message:  1011
<ce>                        The _monster_ is dead.
<ce>                         Hopefully that foolish
<ce>                       merchant has learned never
<ce>                            to cheat a mage.

Message:  1080
<ce>                     Maybe this map to ___newdung_
<ce>                    will sweeten the deal a little.
