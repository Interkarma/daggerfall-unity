QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                   Ah, %pcf, I am glad you're here.
<ce>            If you are available for hire, I am looking for
<ce>                 someone to purvey a special _item_ to
<ce>             an acquaintance of mine. The reward, I think,
<ce>                 you will find to be extremely liberal,
<ce>              to compensate for the danger of the mission.
<ce>                          Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Really? Too busy, perhaps. That is a shame.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     Excellent. Here's the _item_.
<ce>                    Now, _contact_ needs to have it
<ce>          in ___contact_ in =queston_ days.  That ought to be
<ce>               plenty of time, I hope.  _contact_ will be
<ce>               easy to find -- just look for a =contact_
<ce>                  at __contact_.  By the way, you may
<ce>           encounter some orcs who do not want this shipment
<ce>          made.  I trust you know how to deal with their kind.
<ce>                               Good luck.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>              Speed is vital, %pcf.  Orcs have been seen
<ce>                prowling around ___questgiver_ at night.
<ce>                You had best get on the road before they
<ce>                             become bolder.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Ah, good to see you %pcf. And the
<ce>                 _item_ too. Excellent. Here's a little
<ce>               trinket for your trouble. I hope you like
<ce>                      red. Take care of yourself.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_ is still in the smuggling business, I hear.
<--->
<ce>  I hear the guards chased off a couple of orcs last night.  I wonder
<ce>                    what would bring them into town?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Someone found a very lovely _item_ around here recently.
<--->
I hear _questgiver_ is mad as hell at some %ra adventurer.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Some =contact_ was just here, waving around some _item_.
<--->
Some jewelry store has reported the theft of a big ruby, I hear.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I hear that your mission was a success, %pcf. That's good. Very good.
<--->
I was pleased to hear of the success of the delivery. What can I do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    You're the courier who couldn't
<ce>                  complete the delivery, yes? Wouldn't
<ce>                   I be a fool to waste my breath on
<ce>                    you again?  That's a rhetorical
<ce>                         question, by the way.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt: 
 _questgiver_ has hired me
 to deliver a _item_ to someone
 in ___contact_ named _contact_.
 %g will meet me at __contact_
 in =queston_ days to reward me if I have not
 already been minced by the orcs who are also
 after the _item_.

Message:  1012
You don't want to have anything to do with that orc-lover from ___orsinium_.
<--->
_orsinium_ of ___orsinium_?  They say %g actually talks to orcs.

Message:  1013
_orsinium_ is well-known in ___orsinium_ as an orc sympathizer.
<--->
<ce>I know for a fact that _orsinium_ is a filthy orc-lover.  I've seen %g2
<ce> myself, meeting with the brutes outside of ___orsinium_.  %g should be run out
<ce>                        of town, if you ask me.

Message:  1015
_questgiver_ will deny it, but they say %g's in the smuggling business.
<--->
<ce>_questgiver_ is said to be involved in a smuggling ring, bringing in loot
<ce>                     plundered out of old Orsinium.

Message:  1016
<ce>_questgiver_ will bring the orcs down on all of us if he keeps dealing in
<ce> plunder from Orsinium.  _orsinium_ has accused _questgiver_ publicly,
<ce>              but nothing's been done about it, of course.
                                     <--->
<ce>I don't know where _questgiver_ gets it from, but I've seen %g2 wearing
<ce> some exquisite antique jewelry lately.  Ancient Orsinium craftsmanship, if
<ce>                           I'm not mistaken.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   I'm glad you sought me out, %pcn.
<ce>            You should know that the _item_ you are carrying
<ce>       was stolen from Orsinium, the ancient capital of the orcs.
<ce>              _questgiver_, like most people, treats orcs
<ce>        as beneath contempt, hence they are forced to resort to
<ce>      violence to recover their stolen property.  However, I hope
<ce>       that you are more enlightened than your employer.  If you
<ce>       give me the _item_, I will see that it is returned to its
<ce>                            rightful owners.

Message:  1021
<ce>                        Do you give the _item_?

Message:  1022
<ce>              I'm glad I was right about you.  Thank you,
<ce>                    %pcf.  We will not forget this.

Message:  1023
<ce>                That is most regrettable.  Well, we all
<ce>                 have our reasons.  I hope you can live
<ce>                          with this decision.

Message:  1030
<ce>            As the orc crumples to the ground, it gasps in
<ce>                    a barely comprehensible accent,
<ce>                 "_orsinium_ ... go ... _orsinium_ ..."
