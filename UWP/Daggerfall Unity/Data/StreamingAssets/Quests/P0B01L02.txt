My dear %pcf,
 
    We have a small task for you to perform to
 prove your resolution to be one of us. There is
 a _vamprelic_ of ours sequestered like a
 bit of trite incunabula in the Mages Guild of
 __itemdung_. Liberate it from its prison
 within =1stparton_ days when they plan to move it
 to a more secure location.
    Once you have the _vamprelic_, come to me.
 I will wait for you for =1stparton_ days at
 __vampire_ in ___vampire_. I am
 easy to recognize. Look for a =vampire_.
    I am looking forward to making your acquaintance
 less formally, %pcf. Do not fail to come.
 
<ce>                               In death,
<ce>                           _vampire_ of %vam

<ce>                  Pleased to meet you at last, %pcf.
<ce>                      I, of course, am _vampire_.
<ce>                            %vam tribe will
<ce>                       take proper possession of
<ce>                       the _vamprelic_. Don't get
<ce>                     any silly ideas about getting
<ce>                     paid for this. It is an honor
<ce>                          just to serve %vam.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The Mages Guild is getting rid of a lot of its old useless junk, I hear.
<--->
I hear there's a dump where all the Mages Guilds are sending their old stuff.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
With all the security at the Mages Guild, there's something worth stealing.
<--->
They sent that load of old dusty junk out of the Mages Guild at last.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The three stars of Locanda glowed last night. That stands for unholy alliances.
<--->
The Mages Guild is perplexed about that burglary. Who would want that thing?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Salutations, %pcn. Thank you again for the _vamprelic_.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                       %pcf, now is not the time
<ce>                   to test the limits of my patience.
<ce>                    My letter expressly asked you to
<ce>                         bring the _vamprelic_,
<ce>                      but where is it? A very poor
<ce>                       showing, %pcf.  Very poor.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
A sinister-looking character by that name is %di of here in __vampire_.
<--->
An odd =vampire_ named _vampire_ is staying at __vampire_, %di of here.

Message:  1011
_vampire_ is a member of %vam tribe, a mentor to its youthlings.
<--->
_vampire_ is a fairly young member of %vam, but proud and strong too.

Message:  1013
Just a _vamprelic_. Not a very pretty sight.
<--->
A weird-looking _vamprelic_.

Message:  1015
From what I hear, it's a _vamprelic_ of the elder circle of %vam.
<--->
It's a _vamprelic_ used in certain secret rituals of %vam masters.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I received a letter from _vampire_
 of ___vampire_ who has given me =1stparton_ nights
 to steal a _vamprelic_ out of its secured chamber
 in the Mages Guild of __itemdung_. Once
 the deed has been done, I am to bring the _vamprelic_
 to _vampire_ at __vampire_.

Message:  1030
<ce>                   A rolled parchment on the ground
<ce>                     catches your eye.  As you take
<ce>                   a closer look, you are astonished
<ce>                  to see that it is addressed to you.
