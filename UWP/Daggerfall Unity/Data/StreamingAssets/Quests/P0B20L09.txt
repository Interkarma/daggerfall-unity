<ce>                  I salute you, slayer of werebeasts.
<ce>                 Your bloodfather will be very pleased
<ce>                  to hear about the efficiency of your
<ce>                 extermination.  Keep =wereboar_'s tusk
<ce>                    as a badge of honor among %vam.

___mondung_ is the one dungeon no one should ever enter. Ever.

There was triumphant howling coming out of ___mondung_ the other night.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Things are peaceful, still as a grave, in ___mondung_ again.

 Dear %pcn,
 
      %vam need you.
 Come immediately.
 
 
                  Yours in death,
 
                  _vamp_

<ce>                      Honored %pcn, good evening.
<ce>                The ancients of %vam are to meet shortly
<ce>               in %reg, but as if in mockery, a group of
<ce>                 lycanthropes have set up residence in
<ce>                  ___mondung_, where the ancients plan
<ce>                to convene.  Pray, show these vermin and
<ce>                 others of their kind that ___mondung_
<ce>          belongs to %vam and we will tolerate no trespassers.
<ce>           Kill as many of them as possible, including their
<ce>             leader, a wereboar.  Return back here with one
<ce>             of his tusks in =queston_ nights time and %vam
<ce>                 will be most grateful. Fare thee well.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
 I have received a letter
 from _vamp_ of %vam,
 urgently requesting my presence
 at __vamp_ in ___vamp_.

Message:  1013
%qdt:
 _vamp_ has sent me to
 ___mondung_, where a group of impudent
 werecreatures have dared intrude on
 %vam ground. I am to show the misshaped
 creatures the error of their ways
 and return to _vamp_ in =queston_ nights
 with the tusk of their leader as a trophy.

Message:  1017
<ce>                    A pale, wild-eyed boy hands you
<ce>                   a letter and then disappears into
<ce>                             the darkness.

Message:  1020
<ce>                    You have slain =wereboar_, the
<ce>                    lycanthropes' leader.  They will
<ce>                    now know better than to trespass
<ce>                        in a stronghold of %vam.

Message:  1021
<ce>                 Don't make me kill you, bloodsucker.
<ce>                 Go back and tell %vam that =wereboar_
<ce>              sent you home because you didn't play nice.
