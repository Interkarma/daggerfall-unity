<ce>                Good day. _giver_ is the name. You may
<ce>               have heard of me lately. Somebody has been
<ce>                 filling the streets with horrible lies
<ce>                  concerning my private life. I'll pay
<ce>               _gold_ gold to the person who puts a stop
<ce>                       to them. What do you say?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  The malicious, downright slanderous
<ce>                 rumors about me must cease and desist
<ce>                 immediately. I need someone anonymous
<ce>                  to trace these rumors back to their
<ce>                   infernal source. Would _gold_ gold
<ce>                      pieces be enough to buy your
<ce>                      investigative skills in this
<ce>                                matter?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  I guess you heard the one about me
<ce>                  not keeping my promises. Damn lies!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  You will? Excellent. Come back when
<ce>                  you have some proof of who's behind
<ce>                 all these nasty rumors about me. I'll
<ce>                 give you the gold then. If you're not
<ce>                   back within a month, I will assume
<ce>                         that you have failed.

QuestFail:  [1003]
%qdt:
 Someone has been spreading rumors around
 ___giver_ about _giver_.
 %g has hired me to put a stop
 to them for _gold_ gold. I have 1 month to
 return with proof of my success.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              You have been honorable, %pcn. I thank you.
<ce>           Take this _magicsword_, my most prized possession.
<ce>          It is the least I can offer. We are friends forever,
<ce>                             and I owe you.
<ce>                   Leave _giver_ and _sister_ to me,
<ce>                   I have something planned for them.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                   I heard that _giver_ keeps slaves!
<--->
<ce>                       _giver_ beats %g3 spouse.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                    _giver_ is a pariah. Nobody in
<ce>                town wants anything to do with %g2. You
<ce>                 have heard all the things %g has done?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 _lover_ was rescued from ___dungeon_
<ce>                 by some %ra. Hey! Aren't you that %ra?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                 You must think I am a horrible person
<ce>                 after what I did to my sister's lover,
<ce>                   _lover_. Let me make it up to you.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  You failed me! My sister no longer
<ce>                   speaks to me and it's your fault.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
 %qdt:
 I have learned that _giver_ made a deal with
 %g3 sister, _sister_, to kidnap her lover,
 _lover_. There is a letter received by
 _giver_ that outlines the plan.

Message:  1015
_giver_,
 My words will be quick. _lover_ is too
 much, as you have said, and a little scare
 may be what is needed. I'll be leaving on a trip
 tonight, so tomorrow at sunset,
 you should take him. I'll be in touch again,
 but I don't imagine we will need to continue
 for more than a week.
<ce>                               -_sister_

Message:  1017
<ce>                     What's that you say? _giver_?
<ce>               I have heard something... but we must keep
<ce>                 our voices low. Seems that %g3 sister,
<ce>            _sister_, was having a hard time with her lover.
<ce>             I believe his name is _lover_. I do know that
<ce>                there was a deal struck between _giver_
<ce>               and %g3 sister to have _lover_ dealt with.
<ce>             I'm not sure how, but a young chap I met says
<ce>             he delivered a letter from _sister_ outlining
<ce>                          the plan to _giver_.

Message:  1018
%qdt:
 I have shown _giver_ the letter
 outlining the plan to kidnap _lover_,
 and _giver_ has now divulged that
 %g hired some bandits to lock him away in
 ___dungeon_. %g begged for his life
 and asked that I rescue _lover_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                         Lies, all lies I say!
<ce>                   I hate those nasty street rumors.
<ce>                Please hurry up and put a stop to them!

Message:  1021
<ce>                     What?! What is this? Oh my...
<ce>                     Please, please don't kill me!
<ce>                  My sister put me up to it... I didn't
<ce>                  mean any harm. She only asked that I
<ce>                 scare him a little, you know, make him
<ce>                appreciate her more. I know I shouldn't
<ce>                have done it. Now I'm in over my head...
<ce>               you see, I paid a group of bandits to take
<ce>                 him away and lock him in ___dungeon_.
<ce>                I figured this would scare him enough...
<ce>               but he hasn't returned! I went too far... I
<ce>             know. Please... you must rescue him! I thought
<ce>               I could cover it up, but I can't anymore.
<ce>            You've got to rescue him. If he's not back when 
<ce>           my sister returns... well, she'll kill me for sure!
