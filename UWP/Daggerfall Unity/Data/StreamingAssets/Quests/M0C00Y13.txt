<ce>                            I am _qgiver_.
<ce>                 The Fighter's Guild doesn't hand out
<ce>                  charity work. If I weren't short on
<ce>                 fighters right now, I'd have to send
<ce>                 you away %pcn. I do need a fighter to
<ce>                  chase off some barbarian that's
<ce>                  running wild. Do it for me and I'll
<ce>                    make sure everyone knows you're
<ce>                     a stand up %ra. Is it a deal?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    You've just make a big mistake
<ce>                     %pcn. Don't come looking for
<ce>                        work here for a while.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Get your sorry carcass over to
<ce>                         _house_. Run off the
<ce>                        barbarian by this time
<ce>                      tomorrow and you'll be OK.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        Did you get cut up bad?
<ce>                     A couple more jobs like this
<ce>                      and you can write your own
<ce>                   ticket into the Fighter's Guild.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                Barbarians are raiding the farms again.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                 The barbarians looted four farmsteads
<ce>                before the Fighter's Guild stepped in.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                  Aren't you the %ra that chased off
<ce>                            the barbarian?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>               You managed that barbarian pretty well
<ce>                         %pcf. Not bad at all.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  I trusted you to take care of that
<ce>               barbarian. You failed, so I had to send
<ce>                        someone else to do it.
