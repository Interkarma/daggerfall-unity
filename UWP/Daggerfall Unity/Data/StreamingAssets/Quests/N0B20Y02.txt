QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                        I am _qgiver_, servant
<ce>                     to the mighty _sleepingmage_.
<ce>                       I have been instructed to
<ce>                     find guild members to protect
<ce>                      %g2 while %g lies in a spell
<ce>                    trance. _sleepingmage_ suspects
<ce>                        that a rival of %g3 may
<ce>                       send assassins to slay %g2
<ce>                         while %g is helpless.
<ce>                    %g will give you an ensorcelled
<ce>                              _magicitem_
<ce>                          if the assassins are
<ce>                 stopped. Will you take up this quest?
                                     <--->
<ce>                     It is a very great honor, my
<ce>                            dear %pcf, to be
<ce>                       selected to aid the famous
<ce>                          _sleepingmage_, whom
<ce>                   I trust you have heard of before.
<ce>                     Yes, %g has specifically asked
<ce>                     for you to guard %g2 while %g
<ce>                   sleeps. Obviously, a mage of such
<ce>                    standing has enemies jealous of
<ce>                    %g3 enormous power. I trust you
<ce>                        will accept this honor?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        Hmmm. Guild members are
<ce>                      normally more helpful. I am
<ce>                        sure _sleepingmage_ will
<ce>                             remember this.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    As I expected.  _sleepingmage_
<ce>                is just beginning his three hour trance,
<ce>                 so you must guard _magesguild_ during
<ce>                 that time and protect him while he is
<ce>                 vulnerable. At the end of his trance,
<ce>                he will be transported to the Aetherius.
<ce>                  Once he is safe, the Guild will send
<ce>                       someone with your reward.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   A young woman in deep blue robes
<ce>                          bows low before you.
<ce>                                    
 "The Guild sends its compliments on a
 job well done. _sleepingmage_
 is most grateful.  Here is the
 _magicitem_ %g promised."

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
For what you've done for _sleepingmage_, of course, I'm happy to help you.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    _sleepingmage_ has disappeared,
<ce>                    and you were to guard %g2, %pcf.
<ce>                     I have nothing to say to you.
<ce>                        At least, nothing nice.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt: 
 I agreed to protect
 _sleepingmage_ at
 the _magesguild_ while
 %g lies helpless in a trance.
 I must guard %g2 for 3 hours
 starting immediately.

Message:  1011
<ce>                    Stand aside, apprentice whelp!
<ce>                   We mean to cut down _sleepingmage_
<ce>                     before he can awaken. Move or
<ce>                        we'll cut you down too.

Message:  1012
<ce>                     Fool! You should know better
<ce>                      than to disturb a mage in a
<ce>                      spell trance. You shall pay
<ce>                       for this! Leave this guild
<ce>                      hall now. I will bring this
<ce>                       matter before the Circle.

Message:  1013
<ce>                      If you kill me, you will be
<ce>                     thrown out of the Mages Guild!
<ce>                        Leave now or suffer the
<ce>                             consequences.

Message:  1014
<ce>                     I claim bounty on this oath-
<ce>                      breaker to the Mages Guild,
<ce>                    for the death of _sleepingmage_.

Message:  1030
<ce>                     Alert the Archmagister!  This
<ce>                %ra assassin has killed _sleepingmage_!
<ce>                   Bar the doors!  To arms, to arms!
