QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                       Blessings upon you, %pcn.
<ce>                       __qgiver_ needs you to run
<ce>                         an errand for us. This
<ce>                          _religitem_ needs to
<ce>                       be delivered to ___priest_
<ce>                     within =traveltime_ days. You
<ce>                       will receive a temple fee
<ce>                       of _gold_ gold pieces. Can
<ce>                           you do it for us?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Sigh. I shall have to find
<ce>                       some other temple servant
<ce>                         to perform this task.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       Here is the _religitem_.
<ce>                          Take it to _priest_
<ce>                      of __priest_ in ___priest_.
<ce>                     Oh, I almost forgot to mention
<ce>                        that a rival temple may
<ce>                      send out thugs to stop you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         %god's favor upon you
<ce>                         %pcn. This _religitem_
<ce>                        is sorely needed here. I
<ce>                       understand that you are to
<ce>                        be given a temple fee of
<ce>                          _gold_ gold pieces.
