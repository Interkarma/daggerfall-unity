<ce>                         My name is _qgiver_.
<ce>                       My master has asked me to
<ce>                        find a brave adventurer
<ce>                       for a dangerous mission.
<ce>                        I cannot tell you more,
<ce>                       other than to say that it
<ce>                      is worth _gold_ gold pieces
<ce>                       to whoever succeeds. Are
<ce>                            you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      I shall seek elsewhere for
<ce>                         a hero to fulfill my
<ce>                            master's quest.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                         Go to _meetingplace_.
<ce>                        There you will find my
<ce>                                master.

%qdt:
 I met _qgiver_
 in ___qgiver_,
 who told me %g3 master in
 _meetingplace_ would
 pay _gold_ gold pieces for
 an unknown but certainly
 dangerous task.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 The traitor _traitor_
 magicked me to __dungeon_.
 If I ever get out, we will meet again.

Message:  1012
<ce>                       Know me for who I really
<ce>                      am. I am your mortal enemy,
<ce>                          _traitor_! I have a
<ce>                       special fate in store for
<ce>                                 you.

Message:  1013
<ce>                        I didn't know _traitor_
<ce>                      would betray you like that.
<ce>                       I ain't got no beef with
<ce>                          you, %pcn. %g moved
<ce>                    to _hidingplace_ here in town.
<ce>                          Look for %g2 there.

Message:  1014
<ce>                         I don't know how you
<ce>                       escaped from ___dungeon_,
<ce>                         %pcf. It won't do you
<ce>                       much good, though. Prepare
<ce>                                to die!
