QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  Yeah, I got a little job for you. I
<ce>                   wouldn't give this to just anyone,
<ce>                  but I know you do good work. There's
<ce>                 this pack of giants that want killing.
<ce>                 Pay is pretty standard, _reward_ gold
<ce>                         pieces. You up for it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Awright, whatever. Sounded
<ce>                    like your kind of thing is all.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Good deal, %pcf. Our client
<ce>                 places the giants at their stronghold,
<ce>                       ___mondung_. He says there
<ce>                   are six of 'em, and he ain't gonna
<ce>                    pay unless all six are stiffed,
<ce>                      and in =1stparton_ days. Got
<ce>                            it, %pcf? Good.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   You know, until those six giants
<ce>                  ain't breathing no more, there ain't
<ce>                         no time for chattin'.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     %oth, them giants didn't know
<ce>                     what him 'em, did they, %pcf?
<ce>                Here's your _reward_ gold, as promised.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There's a bunch of giants in ___mondung_, but they don't bother anyone.
<--->
I hear the %t wants those giants in ___mondung_ dead once and for all.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Something scared those giants off. Wonder what it could've been.
<--->
If I were one of those giants, I would've ran off too. Too much traffic.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I wonder how soon it'll be before a new group of giants move into ___mondung_.
<--->
I kinda feel sorry for those giants. They didn't really bother anyone.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                    Giants are tough. You did well
<ce>                   %pcf. You'll go far in the guild.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   Giants were too much for you huh?
<ce>                    Maybe the guild should have sent
<ce>                     you out after pygmies instead.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                      All of the giants are dead.

<ce>                       This is GIANT territory!
<ce>                       Go back to your puny lands
<ce>                                %ra fly!
                                     <--->
<ce>                        I ate a %ra yesterday.
<ce>                            It tasted good.
                                     <--->
<ce>                      Smash you! Smash you flat!
