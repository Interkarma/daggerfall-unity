<ce>                  If you are, by chance, looking for
<ce>               work, an easy _reward_ gold pieces, I just
<ce>                    might have a job for you. It'll
<ce>                   involve some combat, but you look
<ce>                      like you wouldn't mind that.
<ce>                   Does it sound like a possibility?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  I see. Well, that is disappointing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Very good. You know that Akatosh is
<ce>                   the God of Time, but He is also a
<ce>                   Dragon God, and we hold dragons as
<ce>                  our holy symbol. One of the members
<ce>                  of our fighting order, the Order of
<ce>                 the Hour, has apparently gone berserk
<ce>                   and taken to attacking our dragons
<ce>                 right in our sacred grove. Of course,
<ce>                   the murderer must be stopped. You
<ce>                     will find the dragonslayer in
<ce>                      a place called ___mondung_.
<ce>                    If you are not successful within
<ce>                =1stparton_ days, we will send the Order
<ce>                     of the Hour in and your reward
<ce>                     will be forfeited. May Akatosh
<ce>                        bless you in your quest.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    You had best move along, %pcf.
<ce>                 You do not have very much more time to
<ce>                        kill that Dragonslayer.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   I am glad to see you back, %pcf.
<ce>                   And your mission was a success. As
<ce>                 promised, here are your _reward_ gold.
<ce>                      Thank you for your service.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The Akatosh Chantry's pretty angry that one of their own is a dragonslayer.
<--->
I say that sneak has every right to kill dragons. Nasty violent creatures.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
It's a good thing that the dragonslayer got away.
<--->
Now more dragons will be killed.
<--->
I hear the Order of the Hour is chasing the dragonslayer across %reg.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I wonder if the Akatosh Chantry is going to try and stop every dragonslayer.
<--->
Ah, it's getting so you can't even slay a dragon anymore without trouble.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
What can I do for the great protector of the dragons, %pcf?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I trusted you to slay that dragonslayer, %pcf. Never shall I do that again.

<ce>                     ever...wanted to...do was free
<ce>                            the...dragons."
<ce>                       The dragonslayer is dead.

 The Akatosh Chantry has asked me
 to hunt down someone who has been
 attacking the dragons in their sacred grove.
 I need to go to ___mondung_,
 kill the dragonslayer, and be
 back at the Chantry in ___questgiver_
 in =1stparton_ days.
