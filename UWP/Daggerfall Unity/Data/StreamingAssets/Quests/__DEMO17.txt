---- Example quest to demonstrate rumor mill and dialog link
---- get information after (and only after) hearing the correct rumor
---- this might be extending vanilla daggerfall's behaviour -
---- not 100% sure about this
---- once an npc talked about the correct rumor the linked dialog option
---- will be available in the tell me about section
---- only one of the two rumors will reveal the chat topic about the person
---- rumor mill is using message 1020 here
---- (you have to switch dialog option and then it will show up in the
---- tell me about section)
---- you can then ask peasants for the correct place where the person
---- can be found
---- one (and only one) of the three possible answers is revealing the correct place
