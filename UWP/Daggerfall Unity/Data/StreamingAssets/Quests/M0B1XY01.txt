<ce>                I like you, kid. This assignment ain't
<ce>                 for just anyone. Seems there's a flock
<ce>                 of flyin' carnivores -- harpies -- who
<ce>               are making a bunch of travelling merchants
<ce>                real nervous. Will _reward_ gold get you
<ce>                       over to ___mondung_ and a
<ce>                      little hackin' 'n slashin'?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Too bad. Seemed pretty like
<ce>                   a pretty damn generous deal to me.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Okay then. There are five of these
<ce>                        beauties in ___mondung_,
<ce>               and they all gotta be dead in =1stparton_
<ce>                 days or no deal. And a word of advice:
<ce>                 you get back here in =1stparton_ days
<ce>                         but get to ___mondung_
<ce>                      as soon as possible or those
<ce>                harpies are gonna migrate and you'll be
<ce>                  outta luck. Okay kid, good luck and
<ce>                            get outta here.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  Listen kid, I'm know I'm a charmer,
<ce>                     but them harpies are waiting,
<ce>                     and make sure to get all five
<ce>                            of 'em, get it?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               Awright, kid, good goin'. That's _reward_
<ce>                     gold your way. Not too shabby.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Someone went up to check out ___mondung_ recently and was torn to shreds.
<--->
I only hope those harpies keep migrating south.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I hear the harpies soiled their nest at ___mondung_ and had to move on.
<--->
Those harpies are following the merchants' caravans like a moveable feast.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The harpies were a real economic problem. Things should get better now.
<--->
I hear they found thousands and thousands of eggs over in that harpy nest.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                      Hey! The %ra who took care
<ce>                       of those Harpies is back.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   You're the %ra that couldn't even
<ce>               take care of a bunch of Harpies. Pathetic.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   That's five. That should be enough
<ce>                         to hold _questgiver_.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild
 of ___questgiver_ has hired me
 to exterminate a nest of harpies
 that has infested ___mondung_
 I need to have at least five of them dead and
 be back in =1stparton_ days if I want to
 collect my reward.

<ce>                  Hey, since you've been so helpful,
<ce>                      here's a map to ___newdung_.
<ce>                    All the killing and looting you
<ce>                         can stand.  My treat.
