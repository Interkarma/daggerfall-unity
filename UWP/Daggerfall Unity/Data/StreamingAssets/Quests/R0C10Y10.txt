<ce>               If you are interested in earning _reward_
<ce>                    gold for doing nothing more than
<ce>                    delivering a little parcel to an
<ce>                      agent of mine, speak up now.
                                     <--->
<ce>                I could use the services of someone of
<ce>               moderate talent, above average discretion,
<ce>                 and willingness to assume the position
<ce>                  of a lowly courier for _reward_ gold
<ce>                      pieces. Are you that person?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Really? Too busy, perhaps? Your loss.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Excellent. Here's the _weapon_.
<ce>                    Now, _contact_ needs to have it
<ce>                      in ___contact_ in =queston_
<ce>            days. That ought to be just enough time, I hope.
<ce>                    You will recognize _contact_ --
<ce>                       just look for a =contact_.
<ce>                        Good luck and thank you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             Couldn't accomplish a simple little delivery,
<ce>                %pcf? I certainly hope you weren't still
<ce>                          expecting a reward.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Ah, good to see you %pcf. And the
<ce>                  _weapon_ too. Excellent. Here's the
<ce>                _reward_ gold pieces I believe you were
<ce>                       promised by _questgiver_.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_ is still in the smuggling business, I hear.
<--->
There's been an extraordinary increase in smuggling lately.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Someone found a very lovely _weapon_ around here recently.
<--->
I hear _questgiver_ is mad as hell at some %ra adventurer.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Someone named _contact_ has been waving around some _weapon_.
<--->
The smuggling of religious artifacts is apparently the big new crime.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Oh, it's my old courier. How charming. How may I help you?
<--->
You look familiar. You made a little delivery for me recently, didn't you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                     You look almost exactly like
<ce>                      a %ra who failed a delivery
<ce>                     for me. Curious. Go away now.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of
 __questgiver_, ___questgiver_
 has sent me to deliver a _weapon_
 to an ally named _contact_.
 I need to have the _weapon_ in
 _contact_'s hands in =queston_
 days. The =contact_
 can apparently be found in a place called
 __contact_ in ___contact_.
