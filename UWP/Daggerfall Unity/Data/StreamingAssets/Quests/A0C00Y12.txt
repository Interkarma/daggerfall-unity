QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                Pardon me. Have you ever read the book
<ce>                    _book_? It is excellent, and I
<ce>           have a first printing of it. Or, might I say, had
<ce>          a first printing. Seems someone has taken it. I'll
<ce>          gladly pay _gold_ gold pieces to the first one who
<ce>            returns it to me. Do you think you can find it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Too bad. I really need to find that book.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Great! It is very important to me, being a first
<ce>            printing and all. Unfortunately, I have no idea
<ce>             who took it. You may try to ask around town.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Splendid! My copy of _book_! Well done, %pcn.
<ce>                Here is the _gold_ gold I promised you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                _giver_ has been desperately trying to
<ce>               find his smelly old book. Who would want
<ce>                          to steal it anyway?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                   I hear that _giver_ finally gave
<ce>                   up and bought another copy of his
<ce>             precious book. Did you know that %g actually
<ce>                hired someone to find it? What a fool!

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                    You must be the %ra that found
<ce>                 _giver_'s book for %g2. %g is telling
<ce>                 everyone about it. You'd think it was
<ce>                     the king that had been saved.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                     Anything for my friend %pcf.
<ce>                  You recovered my precious book and
<ce>                         I am quite grateful.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  Hmmph. I hired you to find my book.
<ce>                   When you failed, I had to go out
<ce>                    and buy another copy. I do not
<ce>                        wish to speak with you.

 _giver_ of ___giver_ has offered me _gold_

<ce>                  You may want to try _informant_ in
<ce>              _informant1_. %g seems to know everything
<ce>                 that goes on around __informant1_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   You should ask at the local inns.

<ce>               _giver_ has been asking around about it.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  I really enjoyed it when I read it.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 You should probably visit a library.

Message:  1015
<ce>         This must be the book that was stolen from _giver_.

Message:  1025
<ce>                   Hello, %pcn. Word is that you've
<ce>                 been asking about me. I should know.
<ce>                   All of __informant1_'s news comes
<ce>                          through these ears.
<ce>              Enough about me. I did hear something about
<ce>                _giver_'s misfortunes. You want to find
<ce>                     _thief_. %g has been looking
<ce>                    for a first printing of _book_
<ce>                for some time. And %g is also the type
<ce>                   who takes things without asking,
<ce>                       if you know what I mean.

 _informant_ has given me valuable
 information about the missing

 somehow. Now if I could just find %g2...
