QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              Excuse me?! Can't you see I'm busy, you smelly
<ce>             %ra? Are you looking for trouble or something?
                                     <--->
<ce>           What? What did you say? I hope I didn't hear you
<ce>                 say something. Did you say something?
                                     <--->
<ce>            Can't you see I'm busy?! And not in a good mood,
<ce>               I might add! If you don't leave now, there
<ce>                could be trouble. Is that what you want?
                                     <--->
<ce>            Well, excuse me! Didn't want to get in your way,
<ce>               you fat %ra pig. You want to step outside?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  That's more like it. Now shove off.
                                     <--->
<ce>            I didn't think so. Go on with whatever you do.
                                     <--->
<ce>                Didn't think you would say yes anyway.
<ce>                       Now begone with yourself.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Oh... you want to play, do you?
                                     <--->
<ce>                     I think we've got a live one!
                                     <--->
<ce>                       Well... looks like my day
<ce>                       just got more interesting!
                                     <--->
<ce>                 You really are as stupid as you look!
<ce>                       Fine, %ra, I'll play too.
                                     <--->
<ce>          So that's the way you want it! I'm game to any %ra!

QuestFail:  [1003]
%qdt:
 I have agreed to duel with _giver_ at
 _inn_ in ___giver_ in six hours.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    As you gaze down on your fallen
<ce>                     adversary, you know that your
<ce>                       honor has been satisfied.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                      _giver_ has challenged some
<ce>                        wandering %ra to a duel!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                     Aren't you that coward, %pcn?
<ce>                    You refused a duel, didn't you?
                                     <--->
<ce>                         I heard that _giver_
<ce>                 challenged someone to a duel, and the
<ce>                        sap didn't even show up!

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                       You're the %ra that beat
<ce>                          _giver_'s champion!
<ce>                               Well done!
                                     <--->
<ce>                        I heard the _giver_ was
<ce>                    publicly embarrassed when some
<ce>       wandering adventurer beat %g3 champion. Serves %g2 right.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                    %oth. I had hoped never to see
<ce>                 you again. You bested my champion in a
<ce>                  duel, but I am an honorable person.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Don't hurt me! You beat my champion
<ce>                     in a duel, isn't that enough?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  Hah! You didn't even bother to show
<ce>                  up for the duel. Thought I wouldn't
<ce>                    remember eh? Shove off, coward!

Message:  1016
<ce>                     Oh, smelly one. 'Tis not your
<ce>                      lucky day. How about a duel?
                                     <--->
<ce>               Then we shall settle this like warriors.
<ce>                       What do you say to a duel?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  I settle my arguments the old way.
<ce>                           How about a duel?
                                     <--->
<ce>                   We'll settle this one. At least,
<ce>                    I will! How about a duel later?

Message:  1018
<ce>             Excellent! Ha ha! A duel it is. But not here,
<ce>              pig. Six hours from now, at _inn_. I'll see
<ce>                               you there.
 
                                     <--->
<ce>                  A bad decision, %ra. The duel is on
<ce>                       then. Meet me at _inn_ in
<ce>                      six hours. I'll be waiting!
                                     <--->
<ce>             Don't push too hard. Effort like that killed
<ce>             a horse of mine ... and it may kill you! Meet
<ce>                   me at _inn_ and we'll settle this.
<ce>                 Be there in six hours. I must prepare.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A duel it is! You'll be sorry... but you had
<ce>                your chance to keep walking. Meet me at
<ce>             _inn_ in six hours and we'll settle this one.

Message:  1019
<ce>                    Then the %ra is not a coward as
<ce>                     _giver_ said you were. %g paid
<ce>                  me well to come here and cut you to
<ce>                pieces. And I shall. Prepare for battle!
                                     <--->
<ce>              It's you! _giver_ said you would be here,
<ce>                    and I always finish %g3 fights.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  You should watch who you mess with.
<ce>                 _giver_ has many friends. Now prepare
<ce>                                to die!

Message:  1025
<ce>            This could get ugly. Not as ugly as you, but I
<ce>             have no problem cutting your head off for such
<ce>           words! You want this to turn into a battle, do ya?
                                     <--->
<ce>                You're lookin' for a fight, aren't you?
<ce>                     Is that what you want, child?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Oh... we do have a live one... with
<ce>                  weapons! You want to use that on me?
                                     <--->
<ce>          The two fights I got into yesterday didn't end well
<ce>           for the other pigs! You want to take me on, do ya?

Message:  1027
<ce>                   I didn't think so. Now shove off.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  That's more like it. Now leave me.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   Now we see who you are. Goodbye.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Pass on by then. I don't have time
<ce>                            to waste on you.
                                     <--->
<ce>                    Then move along. I have a busy
<ce>                               day ahead.
