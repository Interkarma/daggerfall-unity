QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                My needs are rather ... modest, but my
<ce>             offer, I think you will agree, is altruism
<ce>               and generosity indissoluble. In return for
<ce>                        _artifact_, an artifact
<ce>            of great power, I only ask that you exterminate
<ce>            a nasty little bit of fur that has been preying
<ce>                  on some of my friends who live near
<ce>                   ___mondung_. Lupines are generally
<ce>               quite friendly with me and my associates,
<ce>                    but this one ... well, kids will
<ce>                 be kids. Do we understand one another?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Why, you nauseating insect. You poison the
<ce>             air with your thickwitted insolence. How dare
<ce>              you summon forth the greatest of the Princes
<ce>              of Oblivion and refuse the simplest request
<ce>             I could possibly propose? In return for water,
<ce>             I offer you wine and you spit both in my face.
<ce>                     I will not forget this, %pcn.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>              Ah, recognize a good deal, do you? You will
<ce>              find the lupine menace somewhere in a place
<ce>                   called ___mondung_. Unfortunately,
<ce>               time is not our friend in this matter. For
<ce>              reasons too dull to discuss, I need the oaf
<ce>                dead in =1stparton_ days. After you have
<ce>                murdered the creature, meet my friend at
<ce>                    __contact_ in ___contact_. Just
<ce>                    look for a =contact_. Nice doing
<ce>                        business with you, %pcn.
<ce>                       I'm sure we'll meet again.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>              Listen, kid. I don't know how much business
<ce>               you've done with Clavicus Vile before, but
<ce>              I'll tell you this -- he don't like anything
<ce>                done halfway. I know that werewolf ain't
<ce>               dead, and if you think you can fool Vile,
<ce>  you're an idiot. No dead werewolf, no _artifact_.  Simple as that.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Ah, %pcf, Vile told me to expect
<ce>             you. Well, you fulfilled your end I understand
<ce>           so here's the _artifact_, just like Vile promised.
<ce>             He's impressed with you, by the way. Not a bad
<ce>                    friend to have. Take it from me.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I've heard there's some kind of werewolf on the loose around here.
<--->
I hear the werewolf's found a lair in someplace called ___mondung_.
<--->
Didja hear that howling last night? Wolf howling?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Werewolves are real nomads, I guess. I hear our loop moved down south.
<--->
My cousin tells me that our werewolf was spotted down south aways.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Some kind of weird cult activity started up over by ___mondung_.
<--->
A lot of people feel safer knowing that werewolf is dead.
<--->
You heard about that werewolf some %ra hunted down?

Message:  1011
Clavicus Vile is the consummate politician of Oblivion.
<--->
You won't find a more carefully neutral Daedric Prince that Clavicus Vile.

Message:  1012
That smooth talking =contact_ is %di of here in __contact_.
<--->
If you go %di of here in __contact_, just look for a =contact_.

Message:  1014
Supposedly, the Masque enhances the personality of the wearer.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 Clavicus Vile wants me to kill a werewolf
 located in the dungeon ___mondung_.
 A =contact_ named _contact_ will
 wait for =1stparton_ days for me at __contact_
 in ___contact_ to give me the Masque
 of Clavicus Vile.

Message:  1030
<ce>                     You have slain the werewolf,
<ce>                      as ordered by Clavicus Vile.
