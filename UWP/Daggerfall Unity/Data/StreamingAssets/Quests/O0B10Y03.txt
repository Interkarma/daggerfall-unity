RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_temple_ is pretty well-guarded against thieves, it seems.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The guy who owns _temple_ paid some thieves to break into his own place.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
How are you, %pcf? I'm still waiting to hear from the guy who hired us.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                       I don't care whether that
<ce>                     temple was guarded by the Lord
<ce>                         of All Oblivion, %pcf.
<ce>                     There is no excuse for failing

<ce>                             Thieves Guild.
