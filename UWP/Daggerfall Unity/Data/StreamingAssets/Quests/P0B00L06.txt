<ce>                     Lovely. Did you read this? Of
<ce>                  course you did. What rot. There was
<ce>                   another mage who had similar views
<ce>                    of the vampiric tribes, I cannot
<ce>                   recall his name. You've done well,
<ce>                      young one. Very well indeed.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_mage_ is involved in terrifically important work down in ___mondung_.
<--->
___mondung_ is a grim place, but good for _mage_ to get %g3 work done in peace.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
=mage_'s work on vampires apparently has reached the Mages Guild's attention.
<--->
The Archmagister of the Mages Guild himself is studying _mage_'s work.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Tamriel may never know just what poor _mage_ had been working so hard on.
<--->
_mage_ was murdered, they say because %g was working on a charm against daedra.

 Dear %pcn,
 
      Those doddering, unenlightened
 barbarians who call themselves the Mages
 Guild are involved in yet another rather
 pointless endeavor. This time, they may,
 though accidentally, be on a path toward
 breaking the shade and exposing %vam.
 It seems inconceivable that the Mages Guild
 actually accomplish anything, but we must
 make provision for such an eventuality.
 
       Come see me as soon as possible at
 the address above.
 
                      Yours in Death,
 
 
                      _vamp_

 I received a letter
 from _vamp_ of
 %vam in ___vamp_.
 I am to meet %g2 in a place
 called __vamp_ as
 soon as possible.

<ce>               Good evening, kin. The fools at the Mages
<ce>               Guild have blindly stumbled on a few bare
<ce>               facts in their aimless dissections. It is
<ce>               unlikely that they will get anywhere, but
<ce>               the mage who is leading the research is at
<ce>              least wise enough to hide. That, in itself,
<ce>                is enough for our concern. Of course, it
<ce>                     is pointless to hide from %vam
<ce>                        anywhere in %reg. _mage_
<ce>                    is in ___mondung_, a laboratory
<ce>               of sorts. I want you to get the notes for
<ce>                 this research and bring it back to me.
<ce>                      _mage_, I understand, keeps
<ce>              the notes on %g3 person under the laughable
<ce>                misconception that they are safe there.
<ce>                Go point out the error in %g3 thinking,
<ce>                                 %pcf.

Message:  1013
My Dear Old %pcn,
 
    Whenever you might find yourself in the
 vicinity of ___mg_, your
 ubiety at __mg_ would be
 most efficacious to our present needs. In
 return for your support in an endeavor, I can
 offer you the gratification of personal
 economonic prosperity and the more sublime
 pleasure of aiding your Mages Guild compeers.
 
     I hope to see you very soon.
 
 
 
     Yours and all that,
 
 
     _mg_

<ce>                    A courier dressed in deep blue
<ce>                   robes hands you a letter and, with
<ce>                           a bow, disappears.

Message:  1015
<ce>                      Oh, oh, %oth, %pcn, is it?
<ce>                   I, ah, understand that you are the
<ce>                 right one for this, being sufficiently
<ce>                 mettlesome, thewy, in short, puissant
<ce>                            to aid _mage_, a
<ce>                  sorcerer who fears that %g3 research
<ce>                  has attracted the, ah, inquisitorial
<ce>                attention of a local tribe of vampires.
<ce>                  Too much work had made the poor old
<ce>                 sorcerer, well, oversensitive. If you
<ce>                   would just pop on over to %g3 lab,
<ce>                       ___mondung_, and get these
<ce>                 precious notes, I would be very, very,
<ce>                  ah, beholden. Just watch out for old
<ce>                         _mage_ -- %g's a mite,
<ce>                      ah, agitated, I understand.

Message:  1016
<ce>                       %oth! My precious notes!
<ce>                        Away, bloodsucker! Away!

Message:  1017
<ce>                      Wait a minute! Are you the
<ce>                           %ra I was supposed
<ce>                         to give the notes to?

Message:  1018
<ce>                      My sincere apologies, %pcn.
<ce>                  I've been very nervous lately. Here
<ce>                   are the notes. Be careful, though.
<ce>                           Trust no one. %vam
<ce>                       vampires could be anyone.

Message:  1019
%qdt:
 _mg_ of
 __mg_ in ___mg_
 wants me to go to ___mondung_
 to take _mage_'s
 work out of %g3 hands and bring it
 safely to ___mg_.
 Even though _mage_
 is expecting me, %g may be a little
 nervous ... after all, anyone might
 be a vampire ...

Message:  1020
%vam are the dominant
 tribe of %reg, though they are
 by no means the dominant tribe of the
 whole Iliac Bay region. (Fill in this
 about the Montalion, Vrasethi, Ghulari,
 Selenu, et cetera, blah, blah, blah
 Different powers but basically same
 internal structure, blah, blah, blah).
 How is one cured of vampirism (find
 that Vampires of the Iliac Bay book,
 references to a society of former
 vampires)? Slaying the preeminent member
 of the same bloodline, from what I can
 gather from personal interviews and
 whatnot. (Note to me: that rather
 =vamp_ in ___vamp_ has
 expressed interest in my work. Possible
 interviewee or trap?) Vampires infiltrating
 royal courts, Dark Brotherhood, even the
 Mages Guild in %reg and else
 where. Is the %t of %reg under
 influence of %vam or perhaps
 more than under the influence? Run the
 standard test (pend that patent) and see
 what's what. Need Nymph Hair, holy symbol,
 et cetera, et cetera, fresh this time for
 %god's sake. Talk to _mg_
 about increasing funding. Going nowhere.

Message:  1021
%qdt:
 A sorcerer named _mage_
 has come close to major
 discoveries about %vam
 and _vamp_ has sent me
 to the laboratory, ___mondung_
 to retrieve the notes. It is likely that
 _mage_ has them on
 %g3 body, as if that is protection
 against me.

Message:  1022
<ce>                      Is this what _mage_ wanted
<ce>                  to protect? The meandering drivel of
<ce>                   a madman. Still, not your fault I
<ce>                  suppose. Here's _mggold_ gold pieces
<ce>                    for your propitious conveyance.

Message:  1023
<ce>                     A pale young boy hands you a
<ce>                  letter and scampers away like a rat.
