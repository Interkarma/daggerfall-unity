<ce>                     ==qgiver_ have been contacted
<ce>                  by the Mages Guild and asked about a
<ce>                 special potion, a very sacred formula
<ce>                         much desired in %reg.
<ce>                  They would be willing to pay _gold_
<ce>                   gold pieces for it, which would be
<ce>                  yours. All we want is the regard of
<ce>                   the Mages Guild. The journey will
<ce>                      not be an easy one. Are you
<ce>                              interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                           I understand. I'm
<ce>                          disappointed, but I
<ce>                              understand.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     Very good, %pcf. Here is the
<ce>                 potion. Now, you should be safe during
<ce>                the day, for those who want it strictly
<ce>                  travel by night. They are expecting
<ce>                    the potion at the Mages Guild of
<ce>                        ___mguild_ in =queston_
<ce>                      days or less, so tarry not.
<ce>                       Ask for a mage by the name
<ce>                               of _mage_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Ah, a most rare and wondrous
<ce>                   formula. Here are your _gold_ gold
<ce>                      pieces. A bargain price for
<ce>                              this potion.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The peace between the Mages Guild and ==qgiver_ is surprising.
<--->
It won't last, this peace between the mages and the witches.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
==qgiver_ went back on an agreement with the Mages Guild.
<--->
The Mages Guild is cutting off relations with ==qgiver_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The potion ==qgiver_ gave the Mages Guild cures vampirism!
<--->
The potion ==qgiver_ gave the Mages Guild cures lycanthropy!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
The Mages Guild tells us the transaction went through. Thank you, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  We have been working to strengthen
<ce>                  relations with the Mages Guild, but
<ce>                   thou hast destroyed all by failing
<ce>                     to deliver that potion, %pcf.
<ce>                    Get thee from my sight. I cannot
<ce>                         stand to look on thee.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 ==qgiver_ has
 sent me to the Mages Guild of
 ___mguild_ with a
 mysterious potion. I am to look
 out at nighttime for those who
 might want the potion. The name
 of the mage who will pay me
 _gold_ gold pieces for the potion
 is _mage_. I have
 =queston_ days to accomplish this
 delivery.

<ce>                     A voice gritty with the dirt
<ce>                    of the grave hisses, "You! That
<ce>                         potion belongs to us!"

<ce>                    "Give me the potion," somebody
<ce>                     snarls. "It doesn't belong to
<ce>                                 you!"
                                     <--->
<ce>                       You hear someone howl an
<ce>                    unnatural, savage cry of desire.
<ce>                       "The potion! The potion!"

<ce>                              The howl of
<ce>                           a wolf sounds out.
                                     <--->
<ce>                          You hear something
<ce>                          snarl a piteous cry
<ce>                              of yearning.
                                     <--->
<ce>                       The cry of a wolf pierces
<ce>                      the night. It is not a howl
<ce>                      of hunger, but of yearning.

<ce>                           The high-pitched

<ce>                           pierces the night.
                                     <--->
<ce>                         You hear the guttural
<ce>                      snarl of a boar, its timbre
<ce>                        shaking in desperation.
                                     <--->
<ce>                       The still night suddenly
<ce>                      breaks with the high-pitched
<ce>                        snarl of an angry boar.

<ce>                     What's this? The formula has
<ce>                   been desecrated! I am disappointed
<ce>                   that you cannot do this one simple
<ce>                             thing for me.
