QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  Are you by any chance available for
<ce>                  a little assignment that should not
<ce>                   take you any time at all and will
<ce>                 make you _reward_ gold pieces richer?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                               No? Pity.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      %oth, that's grand. I have
<ce>                    a rather dimwitted associate of
<ce>                     mine who left on an assignment
<ce>                          without %g3 _item_.
<ce>                    I need it rushed to ___contact_
<ce>                    straight-away. There's a little
<ce>                     place there called __contact_
<ce>                     where you can find a =contact_
<ce>                            named _contact_.
<ce>                          Give %g2 the _item_
<ce>                   and %g will give you the _reward_
<ce>                      gold pieces. One final note,
<ce>                     %g will be leaving __contact_
<ce>                       in =queston_ days with or
<ce>                          without the _item_,
<ce>                     so you'd best be on your way.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                I've given you the _item_ and told you
<ce>               where it is to be delivered.  What more is
<ce>                           there to discuss?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Are you from _questgiver_?  %oth,
<ce>                   my _item_!  About time!  I thought
<ce>                  I was going to have to leave without
<ce>                  it.  What took you so long, anyway?
<ce>                   What, I have to pay you for my own
<ce>                   _item_?  Very well, if that's what
<ce>                   _questgiver_ told you.  Now, I've
<ce>                   wasted enough time.  I must be on
<ce>                                my way.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
If I had a _item_, I'd sell to that =contact_ in __contact_. Seems desperate.
<--->
That =contact_ has been moping around __contact_ for days now.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Poor _contact_ -- %g3 delivery never came and %g had to leave without it.
<--->
I wonder what _contact_ was waiting for anyhow. Some kind of miracle?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_contact_ left __contact_ happy as a harpy. Guess %g got what %g needed.
<--->
_questgiver_ was singing the praises of some %ra mercenary %g hired.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, my dear friend. How good of you to return. How are things?
<--->
I was informed that your mission was a success. I do graciously thank you.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   You failed to get to my contact,
<ce>                  but yet you return to me. Quite odd
<ce>                               behavior.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
I have been sent
 by _questgiver_ to ___contact_
 where a =contact_
 named _contact_ is waiting
 for a special _item_ in a place
 called __contact_. This
 _contact_ is planning to leave
 ___contact_ in =queston_ days
 with or without the _item_,
 so I will need to hurry.
