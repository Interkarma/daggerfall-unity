<ce>                      an item to a friend of mine,

                                     <--->
<ce>                   I'll have to find someone willing
<ce>                         to work for a living.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       I was hoping _questgiver_

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    Thief! You took my package and
<ce>                      _pickuplocal_ never got it.
<ce>                        I would never help you.

<ce>                    This book has some sentimental
<ce>                      value. _pickuplocal_ has not
<ce>                         seen a copy of _book_
<ce>                               in years.

Message:  1012
<ce>                       _pickuplocal_ needs this
<ce>                       _ingredient_ for a special
<ce>                           brew %g is making.

Message:  1013
<ce>                       This _jewelry_ is a gift
<ce>                       to _pickuplocal_ that will
<ce>                     seal my arrangement with %g2.

Message:  1014
<ce>                   This is a special _mensclothing_
<ce>                        that my mother made for
<ce>                   _pickuplocal_ for the celebration.

Message:  1015
<ce>                    _pickuplocal_ commissioned this
<ce>                          _painting_. It needs to be there
<ce>                          for %g3 gathering tomorrow.

Message:  1016
<ce>                       _pickuplocal_ needs this
<ce>                     _potion_ as soon as possible.

Message:  1017
<ce>                        _pickuplocal_ has been
<ce>                       threatened. This _weapon_
<ce>                     should put %g3 fears to rest.

Message:  1018
<ce>                  I bought this fine _womensclothing_
<ce>                      for _pickuplocal_'s wedding.
<ce>                  It would be dreadfully embarrassing
<ce>                     if it does not arrive in time.

Message:  1019
<ce>                    What do you want? _questgiver_?
<ce>                    Yes, %g promised to send over a
<ce>                     package sometime today. If you
<ce>                     go find %g2, %g might even pay
<ce>                      you to bring it over to me.

Message:  1020
<ce>                       I overheard _questgiver_
<ce>                       saying %g would pay you to
<ce>                     deliver the package. Just give
