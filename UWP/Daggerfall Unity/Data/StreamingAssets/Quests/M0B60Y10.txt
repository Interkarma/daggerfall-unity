QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                We have a new client who wants someone
<ce>                to hunt down an atronach, an elemental
<ce>              golem type critter. The pay is _gold_ gold.
<ce>                          Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     You must prefer the low risk
<ce>                       jobs, like hunting rats.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  A young dandy what I have sworn to
<ce>                   keep unnamed, was screwing around
<ce>               with magic, illegally. Like a melonhead,
<ce>                  he up and conjures an atronach. The
<ce>                thing's gotta be destroyed before those
<ce>                Mages Guild blokes find out. The thing
<ce>                 fled into the depths of ___dungeon_.
<ce>                      If you can do this quest in
<ce>                    =2dung_ days, you'll get paid.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                          Bang-up job, %pct.
<ce>                    Those Mages Guild bananas ain't
<ce>                   wise to our client's shenanigans.
<ce>                     He'll be happy to pay up the
<ce>                          _gold_ gold pieces.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                The Viscount's son has not been himself
<ce>                lately. That's what he gets for trying
<ce>                to learn magic. Ought to stick to what
<ce>                            he knows best.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                  The Mages Guild has requested that
<ce>                         %t %rn give them the
<ce>                  right to punish the Viscount's son.
<ce>                   It seems he summoned an atronach
<ce>                           which went rogue.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                  The Viscount's son joined the Mages
<ce>                 Guild recently. Wonder why he changed
<ce>                         his mind about them?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                       Atronachs zero, %pcf one.
<ce>               You'll go far in the guild at this rate.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  You shouldn't have taken the job to
<ce>               kill the atronach if you couldn't handle
<ce>     it. Now the Viscount's son faces charges of illegal sorcery.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
On %qdt,
 The Fighters Guild of ___qgiver_
 hired me to discreetly off an atronach
 some non-guild mage summoned up.
 It's holed up in __dungeon_.
 I have =2dung_ days to finish the task.

Message:  1011
<ce>                         The atronach is dead.
<ce>                       Hopefully the Mages Guild
<ce>                       won't find out about it.

Message:  1080
<ce>                       And, since you was such a
<ce>                     sport about it, here's a map
<ce>                     to a place called ___newdung_
<ce>                      that's supposed to be chock
<ce>                     full o' loot.  Knock yerself
<ce>                              out, %pcf.
