<ce>                Bit of a rummy domestic squabble, %pcf.
<ce>                   Seems that this woman in __house_
<ce>                has asked that someone rid her place of
<ce>               her husband. The only problem is that he
<ce>               is dead. Are you willing to take this on?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Too bad. Normally only the temples get
<ce>                jobs like this. You've passed up a good
<ce>                               one %pcn.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Her husband is a zombie. He hides out
<ce>               somewhere during day. She never sees him
<ce>                 in _house_ then. At night he wanders
<ce>                 around the place. Put him out of his
<ce>               misery and get back here in =2dung_ days,
<ce>                  and it's worth _gold_ gold to you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               Was the old boy as foul smelling as they
<ce>                say? Like a drawer of knickers left in
<ce>                  the rain for a month. Well, here is
<ce>                            your pay, %pcn.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                 Did you hear? Some old biddy says her
<ce>                husband has returned from the grave to
<ce>                              haunt her.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                 They found a woman dead in her home.
<ce>                  The rotted corpse of her long dead
<ce>                    husband was found next to her.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 I hear the Fighter's Guild sent some
<ce>                tough over to take care of that zombie.
<ce>                    They're a good lot, the guild.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  You did well with that zombie %pcn.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                The zombie was too much, huh? Shouldn't
<ce>                     ever take a job you can't do.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
On %qdt,
 the Fighters Guild of ___qgiver_
 hired me to rid _house_ in
 __house_ of a zombie that is
 haunting it. I have =2dung_ days
 to finish the task.

Message:  1011
<ce>                        The _monster_ is dead.
<ce>                      His wife can sleep safely.

Message:  1080
<ce>                       Hey %pcf, if you thought
<ce>                     zombie-killing was fun, take
<ce>                    this map to a monster-infested
<ce>                       hole called ___newdung_.
<ce>                       Should be a vacation for
<ce>                            a %ra like you.
