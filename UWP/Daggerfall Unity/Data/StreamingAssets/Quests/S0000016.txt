%qdt:
 Nulfaga has sent me to the Mantellan Crux
 to find the Mantella, the heart of the great
 Numidium. It is supposed to be a big, green
 gem. All I have to do is touch it.

<ce>              Only Crowned Heads will hold the Totem True
<ce>           First is One Who Killed, But Did Not Kill Another
<ce>            Second is One Who Is Two Devoured By Its Young
<ce>             Third is One Who Made One Slave and Many Free
<ce>             Fourth and Fifth are Two Who Compete for Mud
<ce>            Sixth is One Who Brings a Home to the Homeless
<ce>        Seventh is One Who Lords All, But Does Not Lord At All
<ce>                                    
<ce>          I do not know who of these seven is most worthy of
<ce>          the Power, for too long have I let my passions make
<ce>           me mad. Sometimes the fate of a world hang on the
<ce>           decision of one person. You have chosen who will
<ce>          command great Numidium. You bear the burden for the
<ce>                             consequences.
<ce>                                    
<ce>         I send you now to the Mantellan Crux, the safeguarded
<ce>           prison of the Mantella. Look for a green jewel of
<ce>           unusual size. Merely touch the Mantella and it is
<ce>            freed. You will be transported back to my side.

Message:  1020
<ce>                   Your work is done %pcn. The world
<ce>            is no longer as it once was. Such is the way of
<ce>             things. Oh, and if you tell my lich statue to
<ce>              shut up, the door to my chamber will open.

Message:  1050
<ce>                  Nulfaga cackles, "Not so fast %pcn.
<ce>          Don't you want to see the result of your handiwork?
<ce>           Look now into the Book of the Time. Read upon its
<ce>            pages the history of what shall pass within the
<ce>           next few days. Read fate as it shall be recorded
<ce>                       upon the Elder Scrolls."
