QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                Thank you for responding to my letter,
<ce>                      %pcf. It is very difficult
<ce>                for a queen of a powerful nation, and a
<ce>                queen whose home is far away, to trust
<ce>                any mercenary. That is why when my dear
<ce>                child Helseth told me about you, I was
<ce>                 so quick to write. There is a rather
<ce>                sensitive situation brewing, and I need
<ce>                  someone I can trust to correct some
<ce>              wayward revolutionaries. For _reward_ gold
<ce>                pieces, will you perform such a service
<ce>                 for me? I am also prepared to reward
<ce>            you with information as well as _reward_ gold.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 That is a pity indeed. Prince Helseth
<ce>                is usually correct in his assessment of
<ce>                people, but it would appear that he is
<ce>                         wrong in this matter.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>         I am glad to hear it. Some years ago, a disgruntled,
<ce>             and possibly deranged, scribe of mine wrote a
<ce>            biography of me which my worst enemy would call
<ce>            cruel and defamatory. Because the book was also
<ce>             excessively critical of the Empire and Septim
<ce>           Imperial family, it was wisely suppressed and its
<ce>            author executed. Unfortunately, chapters of the
<ce>          book resurface from time to time. I have reason to
<ce>          believe one chapter of the book has been purchased
<ce>            by the orcs of Orsinium, who are attempting to
<ce>         publish it. I need it removed from their stronghold,
<ce>           also named Orsinium. Time is of the essence. I'm
<ce>         sure Gortwog will not wait long. Once the chapter is
<ce>           safe, we will talk further about your ambitions.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  I need that book chapter before we
<ce>                          talk, my dear %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         Very well done, %pcf.

 Queen Barenziah has hired
 me to find a chapter of a libelous book about her
 that has been circulating around the Bay. She
 believes it to be in the dungeons of Orsinium,
 home of the orc warlord Gortwog.

Message:  1014
<ce>                        Prince Helseth did not
<ce>                 exaggerate your virtues. Here is the
<ce>                   _reward_ gold pieces I promised.
<ce>                                    

Message:  1015
Chapter 6
 
 "You dance on the edge of a volcano, child," Drelliane
 scolded, as Barenziah admired the emerald ring her lover
 had given her to celebrate their one month anniversary.
 
 "How so? We make one another happy. We harm no one.
 Symmachus bade me to be discriminate and discreet. Who
 better could I choose? And we've been most discreet. He
 treats me as a daughter in public." Tiber Septim's
 nightly visits were made through a secret passage.
 
 "He slavers over you like a dog his dinner. Have you not
 noticed the coolness of the Empress and her son toward you?"
 
 Barenziah shrugged. Even before she and Septim had
 become lovers she'd had no more from his family than bare
 civility. Threadbare civility. "What matter? It is Tiber
 who holds power."
 
 "It is his son who holds the future. Do not hold his mother
 up to public scorn, I beg you."
 
 "Can I help it if that dry stick of a woman cannot hold her
 husband's interest even in conversation at dinner?"
 
 "Have less to say in public. That is all I ask. She matters
 little, save that her children love her, and you do not
 want them as enemies. Tiber Septim has not long to live. I
 mean," Drelliane amended quickly, at Barenziah's scowl,
 "Humans are all short-lived. Temporary, as we elves say.
 They come and go as the seasons do, but the families of the
 powerful live on for a time. You must be a family friend if
 you would see lasting profit from your relationship. Ah,
 how can I make you truly see, you who are so young and
 human-bred as well! If you take care you and Mournhold are
 like to live to see the fall of Septim's dynasty, if indeed
 he has founded one, as you have seen its rise. It is the way
 of human history. They ebb and flow like the tides. Their
 cities and even their empires bloom like spring flowers,
 only to wither and die in the summer sun."
 
 Barenziah just laughed. She knew that rumors abounded about
 her and Tiber Septim. She enjoyed the attention for all save
 the Empress and her son seemed captivated by her. Bards sang
 of her dark beauty and her charming ways. She was in fashion
 and in love and if it was temporary, well, what was not? She
 was happy for the first time she could remember, each day
 filled with joy and pleasure, and the nights yet better.
 
 "What is wrong with me?" Barenziah lamented. "Look, not one
 of my skirts fit? What's become of my waist? Am I getting
 fat?" Barenziah regarded her thin arms and legs and her
 undeniably thickened waist in the mirror with displeasure.
 
 Drelliane shrugged. "You appear to be with child, young as
 you are. Constant pairing with a human has brought you early
 to fertility. I see no choice but for you to speak with him
 about it. You are in his power. It would be best, I think,
 for you to go directly to Mournhold if he will agree, and
 bear the child there."
 
 "Alone?" Barenziah placed her hands on her swollen belly,
 tears forming in her eyes. Everything in her yearned to
 share the fruit of her love with her lover. "He'll ne'er
 agree to that. He won't be parted from me now. You'll see."
 
 Drelliane shook her gray head. Although she said no more,
 a look of sympathy and sorrow had replaced her usual cool
 scorn. That night Barenziah told Tiber Septim of it when he
 came to her.
 
 "With child?" He looked shocked. Stunned. "You're sure of
 it? I was told elves do not bear so young."
 
 Barenziah smile uneasily, "How can I be sure? I've never -- "
 
 "I'll fetch my healer."
 
 The healer, a high elf of middle years, confirmed that
 Barenziah was indeed pregnant and that such a thing had
 never before been known to happen. It was a testimony to
 His Excellency's potency, the healer said sycophantically.
 Tiber Septim snarled at him. "This must not be," he said.
 "Undo it." 
 
 "Sire," the healer gaped at him. "I cannot--"
 
 "Of course you can," he snapped. "I command you do so."
 
 Barenziah, wide-eyed with sudden terror, sat up in the bed.
 "No!" she screamed. "No! What are you saying?"
 
 "My dear child," Tiber Septim sat down beside her with his
 winning smile. "I'm so sorry. Truly. But this cannot be.
 Your child could be a threat to my son and his sons. I will
 put it no more plainly than that."
 
 "The child I bear is your child!" she wailed.
 
 "No. It's but a possibility, a might be, not yet gifted
 with a soul or quickened into life. I will not have it so."
 He gave the healer another hard stare and the elf began to
 tremble.
 
 "It is her child. Children are few among elves. No woman
 conceives more than four and that is very rare. Two is the
 allotted number. Some bear none, some only one. If I take
 this one from her, she may not conceive again."
 
 "You told me she would not bear to me. I've little faith in
 your prognostications."
 
 Barenziah scrambled naked from her bed, and ran for the door,
 not knowing where she was going, only that she could not
 stay. She never reached the door for blackness took her.
 
 Barenziah awoke to pain and emptiness. Drelliane was there
 to soothe the pain and clean the blood that pooled under her
 legs, but there was nothing to fill the emptiness. Tiber
 Septim sent gifts and flowers, and came for short visits,
 always well attended. Barenziah received these visits with
 pleasure, but he came no more at night nor did she wish for
 him. After a month, when she was physically recovered, it
 was announced that Symmachus had requested she come to
 Mournhold earlier than planned, and that she would leave
 forthwith. She was given a splendid retinue, a wardrobe
 befitting a queen and a ceremonial departure from the gates
 of Imperial City.

 Dear %pcn,
 
 My beloved son has brought your name to my
 attention, and suggested that we might have some
 business to discuss. I understand that we have a
 mutual interest.
 Please visit me at Castle Wayrest at your
 earliest possible convenience.
 
 Yours,
 
<ce>                               Barenziah
<ce>                    Queen of the Kingdom of Wayrest

Message:  1017
<ce>               A page wearing the colors and pale yellow
<ce>            rose of Wayrest appears silently at your side.
<ce>                He hands you a letter and disappears as
<ce>                        quietly as he arrived.

Message:  1020
<ce>               Thank Boethiah you found it before those
<ce>               horrible orcs could retrieve it again. I
<ce>                heard all about them losing the chapter
<ce>                  to the King of Worms. %god, what a
<ce>                 crisis it would have been if they had
<ce>                published it. Here is _reward_ gold for
<ce>                            your services.

Message:  1030
<ce>                      You may not know this, but
<ce>                not only is Gortwog the holder of that
<ce>               letter the Emperor lost some months ago,
<ce>               but he is also contending for an ancient
<ce>                relic called the Totem of Tiber Septim.
<ce>                If that cannibal gets his warted hands
<ce>                on the Totem, it could mean the end of
<ce>                Wayrest, and possibly all civilization
<ce>                on the Iliac Bay. We may need your able
<ce>                         services again, %pcf.

Message:  1050
<ce>                      Hello, %pcn. It would seem
<ce>             that we have a mutual antagonist in the King
<ce>             of Worms. I am Gortwog, King of the Orcs and
<ce>             Lord of Orsinium. I am willing to give you a
<ce>                  _jewelry_ if you would retrieve the
<ce>            chapter of Barenziah's book from Scourg Barrow
<ce>            in the Dragontail Mountains, where the King and
<ce>                his Necromancers have taken it. Agreed?

Message:  1051
<ce>             What a shame. Ah well, we'll hire some other
<ce>                            mercenary then.

Message:  1052
<ce>                     Very good. Off with you then.

Message:  1054
<ce>                        Here is your _jewelry_.
<ce>              Nevermind what I will do with this chapter.
<ce>            However, I would steer clear of Queen Barenziah
<ce>                      for a while if I were you.

%qdt:
 The orcish warlord, Gortwog of Orsinium,
 has hired me to continue the quest that
 the Queen of Wayrest began: finding the
 lost chapter of her biography. Rumor
 has it that it is in the Necromancers
 stronghold, Scourg Barrow, in the
 Dragontail Mountains.

Message:  1061
<ce>           A misty shape forms in your mind. An orc shaman!
<ce>             It gives way to a regal orc, wearing a crown.
 
 "The book you are looking for is no longer in
 Orsinium. The Necromancers have stolen it from us.
 If you are available, we are interested in pooling
 our resources against this mutual enemy.
 Please do not be so foolish as to assume that the
 orcs are your enemy, simply because we are orcs.
 If you are interested, come to me at Orsinium Hall
 in Orsinium."
 
<ce>          The face vanishes, leaving you with only a memory.
