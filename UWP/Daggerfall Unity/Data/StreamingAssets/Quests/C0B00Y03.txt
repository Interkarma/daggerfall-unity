<ce>                       %pct, one of our clerics,
<ce>                            a =cleric_ named
<ce>                     _cleric_ has disappeared while
<ce>                     on an archaeological dig. Will
<ce>                         you help us find %g2?
                                     <--->
<ce>                    I fear that one of our noblest
<ce>                           scholars, _cleric_
<ce>                  has disappeared while investigating
<ce>                     an old ruined temple. Will you
<ce>                           help us find %g2?

<ce>                        That's a rather callous
<ce>                       point of view to be quite
<ce>                              frank, %pcf.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     That's good, good. Now then,
<ce>                            _cleric_ went to
<ce>                          ___mondung_ close to
<ce>                      a fortnight ago to conduct a
<ce>                     dig. It's possible that all is
<ce>                      well, but ... I'll give you
<ce>                    =queston_ days to go there, find
<ce>                           _cleric_ and come
<ce>                       back. %god walk with you,
<ce>                            %pct. Fare well.

<ce>                           Ah, %pct and good
<ce>                          _cleric_, it is good
<ce>                     to have you back in __qgiver_
<ce>                        again. I had feared the
<ce>                          worst, to be honest.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_cleric_ was a fool to go unarmed into ___mondung_.
<--->
___mondung_ is no place for a scholarly =cleric_ like _cleric_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Everyone's given up hope of ever seeing _cleric_ again.
<--->
__qgiver_ is grieving over the disappearance of _cleric_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Thanks to that %ra, _cleric_ has started work on a history of ___mondung_.
<--->
Rescuing _cleric_ increased __qgiver_'s estimation of you.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
For what you did for _cleric_, of course I'll help you, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I still remember _cleric_, %pcf. Leave me.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of __qgiver_
 has sent me to ___mondung_
 to rescue a cleric named _cleric_
 who disappeared down there. I
 have =queston_ days to find
 the =cleric_ and
 return to ___qgiver_
 and __qgiver_.

<ce>                      Goodness, you gave me quite
<ce>                          a start, young %ra.
<ce>                    Have I really been down here for
<ce>                      so long? How time does fly.
<ce>                     Well, if you would be so kind
<ce>                  as to escort me back to the temple,
<ce>                            my good %pcf ...
                                     <--->
<ce>                         Thank %god you came.
<ce>                      I've been searching for the
<ce>                      way out for close to a week.
<ce>                  I'll follow you back to the temple.

<ce>                    "Ah, I know the way from here,"
<ce>                         _cleric_ totters off.
