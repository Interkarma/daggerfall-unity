QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                        I am _qgiver_. You are
<ce>                  not a member of this knightly order.
<ce>                 We are not sure if you can be trusted
<ce>                  yet. If you were to slay the leader
<ce>                  of the bandit band of orcs troubling
<ce>                  our area, it might change our minds.
<ce>                 Do you have the stomach for such work?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        Why am I not surprised?
<ce>                      Come back when you are ready
<ce>                          to earn our respect.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     Kill as many orcs as you can,
<ce>                       but be sure to kill their
<ce>                           leader, =monster_.
<ce>                     The foul band is hiding up in
<ce>                         ___dungeon_. If you're
<ce>                      not back in =2dung_ days, I
<ce>                      will know you are the coward
<ce>                         everyone says you are.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    Hmmm. Maybe we should consider
<ce>                     you for membership. Not a bad
<ce>                           job at all, %pcn.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That orc tribe has eluded the knights so far.
<--->
That orc tribe would be lost without its leader.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The orcs will be back. Their leader still lives.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Some %ra came out of nowhere, slew the orc leader, and left.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
What can I do for you, orc slayer?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You are not worth my time, orc fancier.
<--->
Why would I talk to a lousy orc lover?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 the knightly order in ___qgiver_
 gave me the task of wiping
 out an orc band that makes
 it's home in ___dungeon_.
 In particular I must get the
 leader, a certain =monster_
 I need to get back to %g2
 =2dung_ days or %g will
 assume I'm dead.

Message:  1011
<ce>                          =monster_ is dead.
<ce>                      Without a leader, these orcs
<ce>                  will never be more than a nuisance.
