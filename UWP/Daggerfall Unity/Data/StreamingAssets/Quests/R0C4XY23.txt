QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               %pcf, old friend, am I glad you're here.
<ce>             I am in trouble with a group of daedra and am
<ce>                 looking for someone to purvey a rare
<ce>                   manuscript to an acquaintance of
<ce>              mine. The reward will be extremely liberal,
<ce>              but the possibility of daedric intervention
<ce>                  is quite high.  Are you interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     I understand, %pcf. You are a
<ce>                               busy %ra.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Excellent. Here's the book, _item_.
<ce>                    Now, _contact_ needs to have it
<ce>                   in __contact_ in =queston_ days.
<ce>                    You can still make it, I think.
<ce>                 Just be on guard against the daedra.
<ce>                              Good luck.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>              Unless you have already delivered the book,
<ce>                    we have nothing to talk about.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Ah, good to see you %pcf. And
<ce>                  _item_ too. Excellent.  I hope the
<ce>                   daedra didn't cause you too much
<ce>                  difficulty.  Ha!  If they actually
<ce>                 knew what I can use this little book
<ce>                  for, they would have sent twice the
<ce>                   number to stop you!  Here is your
<ce>                      reward for a job well done.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The daedra are excited tonight. You can feel it in the air.
<--->
What could _questgiver_ have done to infuriate the daedra so?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Someone found a very rare book around here recently.
<--->
I hear _questgiver_ is mad as hell at some %ra adventurer.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>Some =contact_ was just here, waving around some old book and cackling to %g2-
<ce>                                 self.
                                     <--->
Some jewelry store has reported the theft of a big ruby, I hear.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I told my contact that you were tougher than any daedra. Guess you proved it.
<--->
Hail to thee, circumventer of daedra. What can your friend do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 The daedra proved to be too much, eh,
<ce>                     %pcf? I'm disappointed. I had
<ce>                    expected much better from you.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
_questgiver_ has
 sent me to ___contact_ to deliver a certain
 book, _item_, to _contact_ in
 ___contact_. I have =queston_ days
 to deliver it to get my reward. A group of
 daedra apparently wants my mission to fail.

Message:  1011
<ce>             Greetings, %pcn.  I have been expecting you.
<ce>             I am _oblivion_, at your service.  My friends
<ce>              in Oblivion tell me that you have involved
<ce>          yourself in their affairs.  I may still be able to
<ce>           placate them, but I must have the book you carry.
<ce>             I should warn you, daedra have long memories.
<ce>              Now, give it to me, before it is too late!

Message:  1012
<ce>               As you hand over the book, a shadowy form
<ce>                             materializes:
<ce>                                    
 "Oblivion appreciates your service, %pcf.
 We have been watching you. It would seem that our
 interest has been justifiable."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                   You feel the book disappear from
<ce>               your grasp as the figure vanishes again.

Message:  1013
_oblivion_ is a powerful mage living in ___oblivion_.
<--->
_oblivion_ of ___oblivion_?  %g's in league with the Daedra, I hear.

Message:  1014
_oblivion_ is some kind of sorcerer, I think.  Try __oblivion_ in ___oblivion_.
<--->
<ce>  A dangerous meddler in daedric affairs.  You'll find _oblivion_ in
<ce>                     ___oblivion_, at __oblivion_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                You deal the daedra a fearful blow, but
<ce>             it remains upright for a moment, eyes locked
<ce>             with yours, and a harsh voice issues from its
<ce>                            bloody throat:
<ce>                                    
 "You may slay my mortal form, %pcn,
 but my brethren will harry you mercilessly
 until we pluck the book from
 your lifeless hand.  If you wish to avoid
 this fate, seek out _oblivion_
 and surrender it to %g2.  As the
 mediator between your world and mine,
 %g alone can persuade my Lord to call
 us off the hunt."

Message:  1025
<ce>             Insolent puppy!  You come here asking for my
<ce>         help, then refuse my advice?  May Oblivion take you!

Message:  1030
<ce>                This parchment reveals the location of
<ce>                 Skeffington Coven in Ykalon, whatever
<ce>                             that may be.
