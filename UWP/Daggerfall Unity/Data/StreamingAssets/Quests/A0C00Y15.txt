<ce>                  I beg a boon of you? Are you passing
<ce>                      by ___pickupregion_ any time
<ce>                    soon? If so, I need to deliver a
<ce>                   package to someone there. I would
<ce>                   gladly pay you _gold_ gold pieces.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     Your reputation precedes you,
<ce>                        %pcn. I am in need of a
<ce>                    courier. Would you by chance be
<ce>                    heading toward ___pickupregion_
<ce>                   anytime soon? Could I entrust you
<ce>                    to drop off a package there for
<ce>                    me? I would pay you _gold_ gold
<ce>                        pieces for your trouble.

<ce>                   I'll have to find someone willing
<ce>                         to work for a living.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     You must be a different %pcn
<ce>              than the one whom I've heard so much about.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       Great! Take this package
<ce>                        to ___pickupregion_ and
<ce>                        ask for _pickupregion_.
<ce>                       %g will pay you. It needs
<ce>                   to be there in =traveltime_ days.
<ce>                          Here is the package.
                                     <--->
<ce>                What luck! My friend is _pickupregion_
<ce>                     in ___pickupregion_. Just ask
<ce>                  around, everyone knows %g2. %g will
<ce>                    pay you right away. If you take
<ce>                   longer than =traveltime_ days, you
<ce>                      might as well throw it away.
<ce>                              Here it is.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       I was hoping _questgiver_
<ce>                would be able to get this to me in time.
<ce>                      %g has been so busy lately.
<ce>                 Here is the _gold_ you were promised.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                The orcs are stirring up trouble again.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>               They say the spirit of dead King Lysandus
<ce>                      has been seen in Daggerfall.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                A sea storm wrecked a ship just off the
<ce>                shores of Daggerfall. I hear it carried
<ce>                     an emissary from the emperor.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>               My humble thanks for taking that package
<ce>                          to ___pickupregion_.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  Scoundrel! What did you do with my
<ce>                 package? Sell it? It never arrived at
<ce>                     ___pickupregion_. Just leave.

Message:  1011
<ce>                    This book has some sentimental
<ce>                     value. _pickupregion_ has not
<ce>                         seen a copy of _book_
<ce>                               in years.

Message:  1012
<ce>                       _pickupregion_ needs this
<ce>                       _ingredient_ for a special
<ce>                           brew %g is making.

Message:  1013
<ce>                       This _jewelry_ is a gift
<ce>                      to _pickupregion_ that will
<ce>                     seal my arrangement with %g2.

Message:  1014
<ce>                   This is a special _mensclothing_
<ce>                        that my mother made for
<ce>                  _pickupregion_ for the celebration.

Message:  1015
<ce>                    _pickupregion_ commissioned this
<ce>                          _painting_. It needs to be there
<ce>                          for %g3 gathering tomorrow.

Message:  1016
<ce>                       _pickupregion_ needs this
<ce>                     _potion_ as soon as possible.

Message:  1017
<ce>                        _pickupregion_ has been
<ce>                       threatened. This _weapon_
<ce>                     should put %g3 fears to rest.

Message:  1018
<ce>                  I bought this fine _womensclothing_
<ce>                     for _pickupregion_'s wedding.
<ce>                  It would be dreadfully embarrassing
<ce>                     if it does not arrive in time.

Message:  1019
<ce>                    What do you want? _questgiver_?
<ce>                     Yes, %g promised to send me a
<ce>                    package. If I don't get it soon,
<ce>                          it will be too late.

Message:  1020
<ce>                    I know you have a package from
<ce>                         _questgiver_. Hand it
<ce>                       over and nobody gets hurt.
