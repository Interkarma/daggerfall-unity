Dear %pcn,
 
    For some time, we have watched you. In fact,
 we have watched you since you received the unholy
 blessing of vampirism. You have had your odd
 and awkward moments, but we are not displeased
 with the vampire you have become.
    The time has come for you to learn of your
 heritage, the proud lineage of %vam,
 the greatest of the vampiric bloodlines. To
 prove your allegiance, however, we require a
 sacrifice.
     There is a haunt nearby where lodges a
 member of a lesser bloodline. Go to the place
 called ___mondung_, and slay =monster_,
 this foul insult to our race. When the deed
 is completed, come to __questgiver_ in
 ___questgiver_ and find me. I am instantly
 recognizable: look for a =questgiver_.
     I will wait for =1stparton_ days,
 %pcf. After that time, I will leave.
 I hope we do not miss one another.
 
<ce>                              _questgiver_

<ce>                    Look, I don't want to be rude,
<ce>                     but I'm expecting someone, so
<ce>                            just shove off.

<ce>                     Excellent, %pcf. You'll make
<ce>                 a fine member of %vam. Welcome to the
<ce>                  family.  I am known as _questgiver_.
<ce>                    %vam will continue to watch your
<ce>                 progress, and we may contact you from
<ce>                    time to time on family business.
<ce>                  Here is a ring that marks you as one
<ce>                                 of us.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
They say ___mondung_ is inhabited again by someone or something.
<--->
There's some weird =questgiver_ over at __questgiver_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Thank %god that weird =questgiver_ left __questgiver_.
<--->
It seems that ___mondung_ has been abandoned once again.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Lots of people are wondering what could have possibly slain a _monster_.
<--->
Wonder whether that _monster_ was killed by something much worse than it.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
_questgiver_?  Never heard of %g2.  Does %g live around here?

Message:  1011
That =questgiver_ is a mentor of the vampiric bloodline, %vam.
<--->
_questgiver_ is a proud and capable member of %vam bloodline.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 I received a letter from
 a member of my "family."
 I have been told to slay a "member
 of a lesser bloodline," presumably
 not one of %vam, in a
 place called ___mondung_.
 Then I am to go to ___questgiver_
 to __questgiver_ and see
 a =questgiver_ by the
 name of _questgiver_
 before %g leaves in =1stparton_
 days.

<ce>                     A gaunt, pale child hands you
<ce>                       a letter then darts away.

Message:  1030
<ce>                      You have slain the vampire
<ce>                               =monster_.
