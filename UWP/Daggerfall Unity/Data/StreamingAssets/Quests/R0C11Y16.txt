QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                If you have a couple days to spare and
<ce>                wouldn't mind being _reward_ gold pieces
<ce>                   richer, I have a mission requiring
<ce>                        some speed and delicacy.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     No? I wasn't expecting you to
<ce>                   turn down _reward_ gold for a few
<ce>                   days work. How many peasants would
<ce>                   murder for that kind of money? Ah,
<ce>                      well. Your life, I suppose.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     Excellent, %pcf. Now, I have
<ce>                       a spy, _npc1_ in ___npc1_
<ce>                 who needs a telescope to continue %g3
<ce>                  survelliance activities. I am given
<ce>                  to understand %g has found something
<ce>                   of interest to a mutual friend of
<ce>                  ours, which needs to be delivered as
<ce>                 well. So, here is the telescope. Take
<ce>                           it to a =npc1_ in
<ce>                       a place called __npc1_ in
<ce>                        ___npc1_, and there you
<ce>                  will get further instructions. Good
<ce>                           luck to you, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  Hanging around here won't make you
<ce>                          any wealthier, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                           You must be %pcn.
<ce>                     _npc1_ told me to expect you.
<ce>                          I am _npc2_. Let me
<ce>                    have a look at that relic. Very
<ce>                    interesting indeed. Well, here's
<ce>                  your _reward_ gold pieces. You never
<ce>                            saw me, got it?

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
If _questgiver_ really has a spy network, it must be pretty well hidden.
<--->
It's said that _npc1_ is a spy, but %g never leaves __npc1_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Turns out they caught _npc1_ and confiscated %g3 illgotten loot.
<--->
They say _npc1_ was a spy in the service of _questgiver_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I always get the feeling I'm being watched everywhere in ___npc1_.
<--->
I wonder if they'll ever find that relic that was lifted from the palace.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Well, if it isn't my favorite spy. How goes it with you, young %pcf?
<--->
I understand that the enterprise went off without a hitch. Well done, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  That quest I sent you on was rather
<ce>                 a failure, wasn't it? There isn't any
<ce>                  pressing reason why I should talk to
<ce>                         you at all, is there?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                     Excellent timing, %pcf. Allow
<ce>                   me to introduce myself. My name is
<ce>                          _npc1_ and I believe
<ce>                  that's my telescope you're carrying.
<ce>                        _questgiver_, I believe,
<ce>                   told you I would have a little job
<ce>                    for you. Take this relic over to
<ce>                         a =npc2_ in ___npc2_.
<ce>                         The name's _npc2_ and
<ce>                      you'll find %g2 at __npc2_.
<ce>                Your gold will be waiting for you there
<ce>                 as well. Be better be on your way; %g
<ce>                 expects you there in =2ndparton_ days.
