<ce>                         You have honored %vam
<ce>                      this night, %pcf. ==daedra_
<ce>                  has respect for us and for you that
<ce>                no other vampire tribe has ever earned.
<ce>                  Your bloodfather told me to give you
<ce>                this _gem_ as a symbol of the permanence
<ce>                         of your place in %vam.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Strange things are afoot in ___mondung_. Even stranger than usual, I should say.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Things have quieted down around ___mondung_. But the daedra stars burn at night.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
___mondung_ has quieted. Even the daedra stars glowed softer last night.

 Dear %pcn,
 
      %vam have need
 of you. Come immediately.
 
 
 
                    Yours in Death,
 
                    _vamp_

<ce>                   Ah, %pcf, you received my letter.
<ce>              The ancient of our tribe, your bloodfather,
<ce>              has asked that you investigate a matter that
<ce>               disturbs him greatly. Here is a copy of a
<ce>               letter he found wrapped around a knife in
<ce>                his sanctuary. Obviously whoever sent it
<ce>                 is of no mean power and wants to test
<ce>                      the strength of %vam. Go to
<ce>               the dungeon mentioned in the letter, this
<ce>                    ___mondung_, find this _daedra_
<ce>                 who wrote the letter and show %g2 that
<ce>                  %vam are no cluster of mollycoddles
<ce>                to be idly threatened or ridiculed. The
<ce>                      pride of %vam goes with you,
<ce>                    %pcf. I will expect you back in
<ce>                    =queston_ days with this matter
<ce>                     settled. Do not fail us, %pcf.

%qdt:
 _vamp_ of ___vamp_
 has given me a letter, written
 by a _daedra_ of
 ___mondung_, insulting
 our tribe, %vam. I am
 to go to ___mondung_ and
 make this _daedra_ eat
 %g3 words. I have =queston_ days to
 do this and return to
 __vamp_.

Message:  1013
Blood Sponge,
 
      My coven tells me that your monsters,
 your weird little pack of blood snorting
 bugaboos, have a monopoly on the terror
 business in %reg, and that my
 own children are afraid to expand their
 dominion because of the raw power of %vam.
 The cowards have been appropriately punished
 and now my coven moves forward.
       If the complacent vultures who call
 themselves %vam truly have an ounce
 of the potency my coven once believed, answer
 my challenge. Otherwise, be prepared for there
 to be a little less room in %reg for %vam
 and your petty criminalities.
       I am _daedra_ of The Coven of
 ==daedra_. Consider the gauntlet dropped.
 I await your response in ___mondung_.

Message:  1014
%qdt:
 I have received a letter from
 _vamp_ of %vam, asking for my
 immediate presence in a place
 called __vamp_ in ___vamp_.

Message:  1015
<ce>                        Welcome to ___mondung_,
<ce>                      %pcn. I take it you are here
<ce>                           on behalf of %vam
<ce>                    to acknowledge that the Coven of
<ce>                     ==daedra_, Prince of Oblivion
<ce>                     is henceforth supreme in %reg?

Message:  1016
<ce>                        Cowardly bloodsucker. I
<ce>                      expected no more, yet I had
<ce>                       hoped. Go back to _vamp_,
<ce>                                 child.

Message:  1017
<ce>                       You dare to challenge the
<ce>                        supremacy of ==daedra_,
<ce>                     to my very face, undead worm?
<ce>                     =daedroth_ will enjoy crushing
<ce>                    your impudent bones!  Show me a
<ce>                      member of %vam who can fight
<ce>                            as well as brag!

Message:  1018
<ce>                          You hear ==daedra_
<ce>                     speaking to you in your head:
<ce>                      "You have proven to me that
<ce>                           %vam are worthy of
<ce>                         respect. You may tell
<ce>                            _vamp_ that %reg
<ce>                    is yours. You are an interesting
<ce>                            specimen, %pcn.
<ce>                   I am certain we will meet again."

Message:  1019
<ce>                         You have failed %vam,
<ce>                      %pcf. The Coven of ==daedra_
<ce>                     challenged us, and you were an
<ce>                 embarrassment. It is a night of shame.

Message:  1021
<ce>                    A terribly pale, wild-eyed boy
<ce>                   hands you a letter and disappears
<ce>                           into the darkness.
