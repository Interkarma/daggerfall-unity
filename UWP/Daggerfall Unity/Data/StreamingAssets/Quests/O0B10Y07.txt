<ce>                       job for us, for no pay, we
<ce>                      might look favorably on you
<ce>                             in the future.

<ce>                    Your assignment is very simple.
<ce>                          The %rt in __palace_
<ce>                   has recently "bought" a _jewelry_
<ce>                of decent enough worksmanship that we're
<ce>                innerested in taking a closer look. Yer
<ce>             gonna have precisely =2palace_ days to find a
<ce>             way into the palace, abscond with said bauble,
<ce>              and be back here. Not impossible for a true
<ce>                member of the Thieves Guild. So, what're
<ce>                         you waiting for, %pcf?

%qdt:
 To gain influence in the Thieves Guild,
 I have agreed to break into
 _palace_, the %t's palace
 in __palace_ and steal the
 %t's new _jewelry_. I have =2palace_ days to
 have the _jewelry_ in _qgiver_'s
 hands in ___qgiver_.
