<ce>                  Excuse me, are you a doctor or have
<ce>               you any healing abilities? I really need
<ce>                    someone that can heal my cousin.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 My cousin is dying! Can you help me?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Damn. I could have used some help.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     Just my luck. Thanks anyway.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     I'm sorry to bother you then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                         Thank you, thank you!
<ce>                          My name is _giver_.
<ce>                I recently received word that my cousin
<ce>                         _cousin_ of ___cousin_
<ce>                is deathly ill and will probably die in
<ce>                =questtime_ days! Whatever you can do to
<ce>                 cure %g2 will be greatly appreciated.
<ce>                  Here is _gold1_ gold. I will pay you
<ce>                 _gold2_ gold more if you can heal %g2.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Oh, you've brought me the healing
<ce>                      Talisman! Thank you, %pcn.
<ce>                  Here is the rest of the gold that my
<ce>               cousin promised you. I really can't thank
<ce>              you enough. I hope the rest of your travels
<ce>                           are safe for you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                     It's too bad about _giver_'s
<ce>                  cousin. I hear it's a fatal ailment.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                        _cousin_ of ___cousin_
<ce>                 died of Wizard Bane. I hear the plague
<ce>                       might break out there now.
                                     <--->
<ce>                      _giver_ is overwrought with
<ce>                    grief. %g3 cousin in ___cousin_
<ce>                             died recently.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 Did you hear? There's been a miracle
<ce>                          cure in ___cousin_!
                                     <--->
<ce>                      _giver_ has donated a large
<ce>                       sum of gold to the temple.
<ce>               I hear %g3 cousin was cured miraculously.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Aren't you the %ra that cured that
<ce>                       poor person in ___cousin_?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                  Bless you, %pcf. I will never forget
<ce>                    what you did for _cousin_ and I.
<ce>                    %g has fully recovered from the
<ce>                              Wizard Bane.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   %pcn! You foul the very air with
<ce>                  your breath. My cousin died because
<ce>                         of you. Out! Out! Out!

%qdt:
 _giver_ of ___giver_ has
 paid me to heal %g3 cousin,
 _cousin_ of ___cousin_.
 %g will most likely die in =questtime_ days.
 I will receive another _gold2_ gold when I
 have saved %g2.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 I have seen _cousin_. %g3 condition
 is even worse than _giver_ said.
 _cousin_ says that _healer_ in
 ___healer_ might have a cure.

Message:  1012
<ce>               I heard about %g3 disease. So far none of
<ce>                  the local healers has found a cure.
                                     <--->
<ce>                I did hear something of %g2. Something
<ce>             about a mysterious, fatal illness. Very sad.
                                     <--->
<ce>              Yes, I know the story. Sounds like Wizard
<ce>                              Bane to me.
                                     <--->
<ce>                No one knows what's wrong with %g2, but
<ce>                   they say %g has only days to live.
                                     <--->
<ce>             A most unfortunate case.  No one knows what's
<ce>             wrong with %g2. You might try a healer named
<ce>                    _healer_, who is said to have an
<ce>              encyclopedic knowledge of obscure diseases.
                                     <--->
<ce>               Oh, yes, the one with the wasting fever.

<ce>                   Hello there. Yes, I have heard of
<ce>                     _cousin_ of ___cousin_ and %g3
<ce>               problem. Wizard Bane, it is. I should know.
<ce>             Anyway, I do have a special Talisman that will
<ce>               cure it. It can only be used once, though.
<ce>                 I'll sell it to you for 20 gold. Here
<ce>                     you go. Thank you very much.

<ce>             I'd sell it to you for 20 gold, but you don't
<ce>                   seem to have enough to pay for it.

Message:  1017
%qdt:
 I have bought a Talisman from _healer_ of
 ___healer_ that cures Wizard Fever, the
 disease that is afflicting _cousin_.

Message:  1019
<ce>            You use the Talisman and it magically vanishes.

Message:  1030
<ce>              I feel so weak. I don't know what is wrong
<ce>                with me. My cousin _giver_ sent you to
<ce>               help me? Oh, thank you, thank you! I have
<ce>                 just heard of a healer named _healer_
<ce>                     in ___healer_ who may be able
<ce>                to help me. Please go to %g2 and bring
<ce>                  me the cure before it is too late!

Message:  1040
<ce>                   They say _healer_ specializes in
<ce>                       the most obscure diseases.
                                     <--->
<ce>              _healer_? Lives in ___healer_, I believe.

Message:  1041
<ce>             _healer_'s the best healer around, they say.
<ce>                     You'll find %g2 in ___healer_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 I've heard of _healer_ of ___healer_.
<ce>    %g has quite a reputation for healing the most difficult cases.
