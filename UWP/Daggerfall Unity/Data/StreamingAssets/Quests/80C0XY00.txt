QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              Yes, I know someone else who was interested
<ce>              in power. A little panikosa in Oblivion who
<ce>              dreamed of power, who asked me to supply it
<ce>                with the beauty and grace it had always
<ce>               desired. And when I made it beautiful, it
<ce>               fought against me, resisting my will as if
<ce>                 I had not made it. Perhaps you are the
<ce>               same. If I made you strong and beautiful,
<ce>                you would respect the gift I gave, would
<ce>                                you not?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Witless %ra, don't you even
<ce>                  know enough to lie? Do not waste my
<ce>                   time with your pathetic yearnings.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                        I believe you, %pcn. In
<ce>               exchange for the death of the treacherous
<ce>              seducer I once trusted, I will give you the
<ce>                 _artifact_, my most prized possession
<ce>             in your world. It will make you most powerful
<ce>               indeed. You will find the loathed creature
<ce>                  in ___mondung_. Slay her and meet my
<ce>                  dear and trusted subject, _qgfriend_
<ce>                  in ___qgfriend_. I will tell %g2 to
<ce>             meet you at the palace there for convenience.
<ce>               I don't think the whole affair should take
<ce>                 more than =1stparton_ days if done as
<ce>               efficiently as it should. Go then into the
<ce>                     world and do my bidding, %pcn.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     Get lost you slobbering %ra.
<ce>                 I'm looking for an actual human being.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       So you're %pcn. Malacath
<ce>                described you perfectly. Good work with
<ce>                     old =monster_. She just didn't
<ce>               know how to keep her mouth shut, you know?
<ce>                  Anyhow, here's the _artifact_. Not a
<ce>             halfbad smasher. And who knows? You might have
<ce>                 to use it on Malacath himself one day.
<ce>                             I'm joking ...
<ce>                               of course.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_murder_ was found dead, right in %g3 palace in ___ruler_.
<--->
Most daedra seducers have a mission. The one in ___mondung_ is just waiting.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I'm still thinking about that woman's laughter I heard coming from the sky.
<--->
Don't know where, but a lot of people saw her flying around some nights ago.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear that seducer was murdered by her master's agents for falling in love.
<--->
Made me nervous -- that seducer just sitting in that hole, waiting for something.

Message:  1011
_qgfriend_ is a noble, rumored to have had a secret romance with a dark lady.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is a noble with a lot of secret allegiances.

Message:  1012
Malacath is the Daedra Prince of Lies, Deception, and Hypocrisy.
<--->
Malacath breeds lies like a dead dog breeds maggots.

Message:  1013
<ce>      The _artifact_ is a war hammer of great power, able to sap
<ce>                      the strength of its victims.


Message:  1015
=monster_ is dead.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I summoned the Daedra Prince Malacath
 who has offered the _artifact_ in exchange for
 the death of =monster_, a daedra seducer
 formerly affiliated with him. The seducer has sought
 refuge in a place called ___mondung_.
 If I can kill =monster_ and get to the Palace of
 ___qgfriend_ within =1stparton_ days,
 a =qgfriend_ named _qgfriend_ will give
 me the _artifact_.

Message:  1030
=monster_,
 
      Malacath wishes _murder_ dead.
 %g3 agents have uncovered one too many of
 our plots.  %g must be stopped before all
 our plans for %reg are ruined.  You will
 find %g2 in the Palace of ___ruler_.  Make
 sure %g3 death cannot be traced back to us.
     Once you have carried out the assassination,
 wait for me in ___mondung_.  I will bring
 your reward and your next assignment from
 Malacath.
 
<ce>                               _qgfriend_

Message:  1040
<ce>                     %oth!  _qgfriend_ was behind
<ce>                    _murder_'s death?  And involved
<ce>                   in a daedra plot as well?  We may
<ce>                 never have solved this murder without
<ce>                   your help, %pcn.  Your loyalty to
<ce>                     the %rt will not be forgotten.

Message:  1041
<ce>                       Do you give _qgfriend_'s
<ce>                            note to _ruler_?

Message:  1050
<ce>_murder_'s death is still a mystery.  _ruler_ is leading the investigation,
<ce>                        but so far has no leads.
                                     <--->
<ce>I'm sure _murder_ was killed because of %g3 investigation of corruption
<ce>                                in %reg.

Message:  1051
<ce>  _murder_ was investigating a plot to overthrow %rt %rn when %g was
<ce> "mysteriously" killed.  _ruler_ is trying to find out who was responsible,
<ce>                but %g'll never get to the bottom of it.
                                     <--->
<ce>_murder_ was found dead in the Palace of ___ruler_, and all %g3 notes on %g3
<ce>    investigation into high-level treason were stolen.  _ruler_ was
<ce>      sent to track down the killer, but %g has nothing to go on.

Message:  1052
<ce>      _ruler_ is leading the investigation into _murder_'s death,
<ce>                        but so far has no leads.
                                     <--->
<ce> _ruler_ is investigating _murder_'s death at the Palace of ___ruler_.

Message:  1053
