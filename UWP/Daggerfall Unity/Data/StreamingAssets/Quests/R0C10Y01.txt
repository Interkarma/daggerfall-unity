QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  If you want work, I am looking for
<ce>                  someone to take a special _item_ to
<ce>                  an acquaintance of mine. The reward
<ce>                 will be extremely liberal. Interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Really? Too busy, perhaps. That is a shame.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     Excellent. Here's the _item_.
<ce>                    Now, _contact_ needs to have it
<ce>                   in ___contact_ in =queston_ days.
<ce>               That ought to be just enough time, I hope.
<ce>                    You will recognize _contact_ --
<ce>                  go to a place called __contact_ and
<ce>                       just look for a =contact_.
<ce>                        Good luck and thank you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             %pcf, you had better get busy with our little
<ce>                              arrangement.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Ah, good to see you %pcf. And the
<ce>                 _item_ too. Excellent. Here's a little
<ce>               trinket for your trouble. I hope you like
<ce>                      red. Take care of yourself.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_questgiver_ is still in the smuggling business, I hear.
<--->
There's been an extraordinary increase in smuggling lately.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Someone found a very lovely _item_ around here recently.
<--->
I hear _questgiver_ is mad as hell at some %ra adventurer.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Some =contact_ was just here, waving around some _item_.
<--->
Some jewelry store has reported the theft of a big ruby, I hear.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, %pcf. I hope you're keeping that ruby safe, my friend.
<--->
Hello again, my young friend.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   I guess you've come to apologize
<ce>                   for that botched smuggling affair.
<ce>                         Apology not accepted.
                                     <--->
<ce>                      You're the %ra who couldn't
<ce>                   even accomplish a simple delivery,
<ce>                    eh? Why would I waste my breath
<ce>                                on you?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
_questgiver_
 asked me to deliver a _item_ to a contact
 in ___contact_ called _contact_.
 I need to have the _item_ delivered to %g2 at
 __contact_ in =queston_
 days or my reward will be forfeit.
