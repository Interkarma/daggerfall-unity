QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                           Welcome %pcn. My
<ce>                      name is _qgiver_. The order
<ce>                  has just been told of a crazed, orc
<ce>                  mercenary that needs to be stopped.
<ce>                    Are you willing to take up this
<ce>                                 quest?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Your modesty does you justice,
<ce>                       %pcf. Feel free to return
<ce>                   when you are less faint of heart.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Very well. In a dark pit not too far away,
<ce>                   a cursed place called ___mondung_,
<ce>                      an _soldier_ named =soldier_
<ce>              has been conspiring with a group of renegade
<ce>              mages, even worse than the Necromancers, to
<ce>                  destroy %reg. Perhaps he feels that
<ce>                he was wronged by the %t, perhaps it is
<ce>              merely the unreasoning hate that orcs often
<ce>             exhibit toward humans. The important thing is
<ce>             that he must be stopped, before his blind fury
<ce>                 and the magic of the mages have truly
<ce>                   disastrous results. Stop him, %pcf
<ce>               any way you can. If you have not returned
<ce>            with the situation remedied in =2mondung_ days,
<ce>              if it isn't too late, we knights will do the
<ce>            job ourselves. Pray, do not let it come to that.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                         Should you not be in
<ce>                         ___mondung_ now, %pcf?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Well done, %pcf. The orcs are moving
<ce>                out of ___mondung_, so your mission must
<ce>                 have been successful. You are truly a
<ce>                      worthy member of our order.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
___mondung_ is a perfect location for the orcs to gather -- it's so remote.
<--->
The orcs and the renegade mages are planning something horrible for %reg.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The land has been cursed by the mages. It may be war, plague, famine, or all.
<--->
No one could do anything to stop the unholy alliance of orc and mage.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The orcs have left ___mondung_ suddenly. Their leader was sick or even dead.
<--->
%reg was saved by the sacrifice of a brave and resourceful %ra mercenary.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Greetings, %pct. How goes it with you, Orc Slayer?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Dashed pity about those orcs and mages getting away. Well, it happens.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of __qgiver_
 in ___qgiver_ wants me
 to stop an _soldier_ bent on destroying
 %reg. The orc lives in a hole
 called ___mondung_ with
 his troops. I have =2mondung_ days to deal
 with this threat and return to
 __qgiver_.

Message:  1013
<ce>                   You are handed a smudged note by
<ce>                 an even more smudged little boy. He's
<ce>               obviously not a professional courier, but
<ce>                 he moves almost as quickly as he runs
<ce>                                 away.

Message:  1014
<ce>                     You have slain the _soldier_.

Message:  1015
<ce>              Ah, that hair. So, she lives yet ... I must
<ce>                 tell Skullsplitter that his lady love
<ce>               has not left %reg. Thank you for bringing
<ce>                 it to my attention, %pcf. If my master
<ce>                had brought death to %reg with the help
<ce>               of his mage allies, he might have slain a
<ce>               woman that means more to him that the most
<ce>                bloody revenge he could have on the %t.
<ce>                    Once again, I thank you, friend.

Message:  1017
<ce>                  I heared you were a godsend, %pct.
<ce>                     %god bless you and keep you. I
<ce>               wish I could give ya something to aspress
<ce>               my gratitude. Here, I got this from a lady
<ce>                who felt sorry for me. It is so fine and
<ce>                lovely, I couldn sell even when I was so
<ce>                 hunger. Please take it for my thanks.
