QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              I have a somewhat complicated mission that
<ce>              needs a fourth man involved. It might take
<ce>                a couple of days to accomplish, but it
<ce>           will mean an extra _reward_ gold in your pocket.
<ce>                           Sound intriguing?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       That is a disappointment.
<ce>                               Ah well.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   I have a contact in ___npc1_ who
<ce>            has a certain item needed by another associate
<ce>                        of mine in ___npc2_. Of
<ce>                     course, _npc1_, my contact in
<ce>                       ___npc1_ needs to be paid
<ce>                for %g3 item. That is why I need you to
<ce>                   bring this diamond as payment to
<ce>                       _npc1_. The diamond needs
<ce>                        to be in %g3 possession
<ce>             in =1stparton_ days. Once you have made it to
<ce>                       __npc1_, _npc1_ will give
<ce>                 you further instructions. Thank you,
<ce>                      %pcf, and %god be with you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   I know it was complicated, %pcf,
<ce>                but I assumed you had at least a small
<ce>                 brain encased in that thick skull of
<ce>                 yours.  I hope you were taking notes,
<ce>               because I'm not in the habit of repeating
<ce>                                myself.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                           Ah, the _item2_.
<ce>                  I was afraid it would never arrive.
<ce>             Well, here's your _reward_ gold, as promised.
<ce>                        Tell _npc1_ I am in %g3
<ce>                     debt. And thank you as well.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_npc2_ in __npc2_ is still screeching about %g3 _item2_.
<--->
%oth, that _npc1_ is greedy. Wouldn't help %g3 own mother without payment.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I hear _questgiver_ is mad as hell at some %ra adventurer.
<--->
_npc2_ left __npc2_ in a rage over some kinda lost magical item of %g3.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I wonder what the connection is between _questgiver_ and _npc2_.
<--->
I hear _npc1_ sold %g3 _item2_. What in Tamriel could the price have been?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Well, if it isn't %pcn, the ultimate courier. How are you, my friend?
<--->
You helped me when I was in need, %pcf. What can I do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                       I take it you've come to
<ce>                     apologize for your incomplete
<ce>                           couriering, %pcf.
<ce>                         Apology not accepted.
<ce>                             Leave me now.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                   Thank %god you've arrived, %pcf.
<ce>               Give me the diamond quick. Now take this
<ce>                        _item2_ and bring it to
<ce>                       _npc2_ over in __npc2_ --
<ce>                       that's in ___npc2_. Once
<ce>                    you're there, %g will pay you.
