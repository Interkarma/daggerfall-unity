<ce>                  It is not an easy thing for one of
<ce>                   our kind to travel. With the added
<ce>                        encumbrance of _vamp_,
<ce>                  I can only imagine your tribulation.
<ce>                 Add to it the terror of that venomous
<ce>                         =mage_, and I can see
<ce>                        why %vam speak so highly
<ce>                           of you, good %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
=mage_ is the only decent vampire-hunter left in %reg, according to some.
<--->
=mage_ could give most vampires a decent fight.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Some =vamp2_ in __vamp2_ was looking for a %ra named %pcn.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
=mage_ apparently isn't the vampire-hunter %g claims to be.
<--->
=mage_ was supposed to be a great vampire-hunter. Guess %g wasn't so great.

 Dear %pcn,
 
      %vam need you.
 Come immediately.
 
 
                    Yours in Death,
 
                    _vamp_

 I have received
 a letter from _vamp_,
 a vampire of %vam urgently
 requesting my presence in
 ___vamp_ at a
 place called __vamp_.

Message:  1012
<ce>                Thank you for coming so promptly. There
<ce>               is a dangerous enemy of our tribe here in
<ce>                      %reg, a mage called =mage_.
<ce>                I myself had an unfortunate meeting with
<ce>                   %g2. It is imperative that I speak
<ce>                          with _vamp2_ over in
<ce>                      ___vamp2_ about this matter,
<ce>                       but I know that =mage_ is
<ce>               looking for me. I am too weak to make the
<ce>                 journey myself. You must escort me to
<ce>                         __vamp2_ in ___vamp2_,
<ce>                and we must hurry before the devil mage
<ce>                brings in more allies. =queston_ nights,
<ce>                          %pcf. It isn't long,
<ce>                            but we must try.

Message:  1013
<ce>                     A bloodsucker with some sting
<ce>                    left. This ought to make things
<ce>                           more interesting!

Message:  1014
%qdt:
 I am escorting _vamp_
 to _vamp2_ in ___vamp2_.
 I must make it to __vamp2_
 before the mage who is stalking us
 has a chance to call reinforcements.

Message:  1015
<ce>                         "%pcf!" says _vamp_,
<ce>                        "You have slain =mage_,
<ce>                         the scourge of %vam!"

Message:  1016
<ce>                          "You are taking too
<ce>                          long," says _vamp_,
<ce>                       staggering off on %g3 own.

Message:  1017
<ce>                        A pale, fierce-eyed boy
<ce>                      hands you a letter and then
<ce>                      disappears into the shadows.
