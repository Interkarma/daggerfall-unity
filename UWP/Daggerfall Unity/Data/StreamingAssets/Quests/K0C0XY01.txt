QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>          I have a not uncommon situation on my hands. A nest
<ce>           of harpies has moved into an old property of mine,
<ce>          and while I personally couldn't care less, our wise
<ce>            and benevolent %rt has decreed that the owner of
<ce>          any structure infested by harpies is responsible for
<ce>           extermination. There is apparently a fine involved
<ce>           for noncompliance. Frankly, I don't have the time
<ce>           for this; but if you wouldn't mind bloodying your
<ce>              sword a bit, I could use your help. The last
<ce>              mercenary I hired didn't make it, so I would
<ce>             understand if you're hesitant. I'd be happy to
<ce>          pay you, say, _reward_ gold pieces for your trouble.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    %oth. Well, I can't blame you.
<ce>            Never could abide the stench of harpies myself.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Would you? Marvelous. Now, the catch is that I
<ce>             must have proof that a serious effort has been
<ce>              made to clear out ___mondung_ in =2mondung_
<ce>              days. Obviously that does not leave a lot of
<ce>                   time. I had hoped that _contact_,
<ce>          the mercenary I had hired earlier from the Fighters
<ce>            Guild would have been more capable. And, listen,
<ce>                   %pcf, you don't have to clear out
<ce>                all ___mondung_. Just kill four or five
<ce>             of the critters and get back here. I know! The
<ce>               clan leaders wear specially dyed gryphon's
<ce>                   feathers. Bring back one of those
<ce>               and I'll have the proof I need. Just make
<ce>             certain you don't fail to return in =2mondung_
<ce>                              days, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 %oth. That wasn't much of an effort.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Well done, %pcf. Now I can prove to the
<ce>             %rt that I've done my civic duty, or at least
<ce>           attempted to do it. You have earned your _reward_
<ce>                        gold indeed. Thank you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The %rt demands physical proof of harpy extermination from some mercenaries.
<--->
_qgiver_ has really let ___mondung_ go to seed. It's hardly a storehouse now.
<--->
_qgiver_ ought to have ___mondung_ destroyed if it isn't going to be used.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The %rt slapped _qgiver_ with so many fines, I wonder if %g'll recover.
<--->
_qgiver_ has had some real bad luck with harpy exterminators from what I see.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The %rt seems happy with _qgiver_'s efforts to get ___mondung_ cleaned out.
<--->
_qgiver_ has made %g3 first effort to get that filthy ___mondung_ cleaned up.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You helped me with those harpies, %pcf. What can I help you with?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I have nothing to say to a %ra who can't pick up a few feathers.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      Thank you, %pcf. I know my
<ce>                          way home from here.

Message:  1012
__qgiver_, ___qgiver_
 Dear %pcn,
 
      I am sorry to annoy you while I'm sure you're
 busy, but I received a caller from the Fighters Guild
 on the subject of _contact_, that
 mercenary I first hired to clean out ___mondung_.
      Without boring you with the details of the
 interview, let me tell you that I promised the
 Guildmaster I'd ask you to look for _contact_
 while you're in ___mondung_. _contact_
 looks is a =contact_, so %g should
 stick out at ___mondung_.
      Well, I've fulfilled my promise to the Guildmaster.
 Personally, I don't care if you throw this letter away
 and let _contact_ rot in ___mondung_.
 
      I am eagerly awaiting your return.
 
<ce>                              Yours truly,
<ce>                                _qgiver_

Message:  1013
<ce>                         You're from _qgiver_?
<ce>                        Thank %god you arrived,
<ce>                          %pcf. Hope you don't
<ce>                          mind if I join you.
<ce>                         Take this _jewelry_ as
<ce>                        a sign of my gratitude.

Message:  1014
<ce>            A young courier appears at your side, hands you
<ce>                a letter, and disappears without a word.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 _qgiver_, a
 merchant in ___qgiver_ has hired me
 to clear out %g3 desolate property,
 ___mondung_, which is infested by
 harpies. Apparently, the place does not
 have to be cleared out, but some sort of
 effort needs to be made or at least the
 appearance of an effort. I must return
 with a clan feather from one of the leaders in
 =2mondung_ days for a reward of _reward_ gold pieces.
