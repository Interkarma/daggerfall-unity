<ce>                     Let me introduce myself. I am
<ce>                         _qgiver_ of ==qgiver_.
<ce>                      Seems there is a bandit band
<ce>                     of orcs holed up around here.
<ce>                         The glory of %reg will
<ce>                     go to whomever wipes them out.
<ce>                       Can I count on you, %pcf?
                                     <--->
<ce>                     The orcs are moving into fair
<ce>                        %reg, befouling the land
<ce>                    as they progress. Will you help
<ce>                         us in this purgation?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      You're my fourth rejection
<ce>                     today. Seems like nobody wants
<ce>                        to tackle orcs any more.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     You don't need to kill every
<ce>                      single orc in the band. Just
<ce>                      get a decent number of them
<ce>                       and be sure to kill their
<ce>                           leader, =monster_.
<ce>                         I happen to know that
<ce>                          they are holed up in
<ce>                         __dungeon_. If you're
<ce>                     not back in =2dung_ days, I'll
<ce>                        sing your praises at the
<ce>                           funeral ceremony.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Good show! The merchants are
<ce>                      already telling me how happy
<ce>                      they are with the orcs gone.
<ce>                     You are a credit to the Order.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The orcs of __dungeon_ are all but destroying normal caravan routes.
<--->
The __dungeon_ orcs used to be fairly peaceful. They sure ain't anymore.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The orcs moved on, all on their own. But I bet that they'll be back.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The %kno saved %reg from the __dungeon_ orcs. The hero was a %ra knight.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I'd be happy to be of service, o Orc Destroyer.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Oh, hello, %pct. I'd be happier to see you if that orc business was successful.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 ==qgiver_ in ___qgiver_
 gave me the task of wiping
 out an orc band that makes
 it's home in __dungeon_.
 In particular I must get the
 leader, a certain _monster_.
 I need to get back to %g2
 in =2dung_ days or %g will
 assume I'm dead.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      You have killed =monster_.
<ce>                      Without a leader, these orcs
<ce>                  will never be more than a nuisance.
