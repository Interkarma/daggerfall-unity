QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  I have a mission of some diplomatic
<ce>                    importance. A gift of peace that
<ce>                 needs be exchanged.  As a favor to me,
<ce>                 would you bring my gift to my friend,
<ce>                               _contact_?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Is it the price, the inconvenience,
<ce>                  or the lowliness of the mission that
<ce>                       irks you, %pcf? No matter,
<ce>                     I can easily find another %ra
<ce>                        interested in furthering
<ce>                        his political standing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                           Very good, %pcf.
<ce>                Now, listen carefully: take this _item_
<ce>            to the palace in __palace_ and find a =contact_.
<ce>                   That will be _contact_. %g will be
<ce>                 expecting you, and will likely reward
<ce>                  you for your trouble.  You'd best be
<ce>                  on your way.  Do not fail me, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     Quickly now, begone!  This is
<ce>                   no time for idle conversation. You
<ce>                            have work to do.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       Oh, what a lovely _item_.
<ce>                        It's from _questgiver_?
<ce>                      Well, perhaps this was just
<ce>                     a misunderstanding after all.
<ce>                     Here's _reward_ gold for your
<ce>                          good services, %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I hear _contact_ is considering breaking allegiance with _questgiver_.
<--->
_questgiver_ better do something to cement relations with _contact_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_questgiver_ and _contact_ seem more estranged than ever.
<--->
I wouldn't be surprised if _contact_ and _questgiver_ broke ties altogether.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_contact_ is supposed to be very pleased with the present from _questgiver_.
<--->
Thank %god _questgiver_ got that _item_ to _contact_. Could've been nasty.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, it's my agent of peace. How goes it with you, my friend?
<--->
%oth, if it isn't my favorite courier. How are you doing?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                   By failing to bring _contact_ the
<ce>                      _item_ you promised to get,
<ce>                 you've made my peace plans rather more
<ce>                            difficult, %pcf.
<ce>                            Out of my sight.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
_questgiver_ has
 given me _reward_ gold to go
 to __palace_ palace
 to bring a peace offering, a _item_
 to _contact_.  I must be there in
 =queston_ days or less.

Message:  1020
<ce>                           Did _questgiver_
<ce>                       not give you something for
<ce>                   me?  Damnation, if this is one of
<ce>                             %g3 tricks ...
