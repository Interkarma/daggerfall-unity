<ce>                Oh, my. I bet ye weren't expecting me!
<ce>               My unbrothers and nonsisters are sometimes
<ce>                 a bit slow, so I step in for them. Too
<ce>                 bad for thou. You'll just have to cut
<ce>                  thy deal with me. Be quick about it!
<ce>                 Before the hour of the pale be passed,
<ce>                   have I plenty to do elsewhere. So!
<ce>                     Power the %ra craves to rub on
<ce>                   the body and ease the four hundred
<ce>                 sores of mortal life? Yes, Sheogorath
<ce>                  has power, power enough to pull the
<ce>                  branches across the eyes of the moon
<ce>                 and rain blood over Tamriel. For this
<ce>                    power, wilt thou send someone an
<ce>                       invitation to tea for me?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     La, rejected by a squalid %ra
<ce>                   with lice in its hair. How far has
<ce>                   Sheogorath risen! I shall have to
<ce>                    ask for a raise in my allowance.
<ce>                             Tirrah, %pct.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                To tea, to a tea party with me! Go, go
<ce>                     to a place called ___mondung_,
<ce>                 where the object of my gallous desires
<ce>                 doth trip and pose and wear blackberry
<ce>                  crowns. Wait ... do not invite this
<ce>                    battlemage to tea with me. Now I
<ce>                        remember. This =monster_
<ce>                    the name is. Kill %g2 to death,
<ce>                murder %g2 fatally, that's what I wish.
<ce>                     Then go from ___mondung_ to a
<ce>                 lunatic asylum called ___contactdung_
<ce>                         and see my =qgfriend_,
<ce>                       _qgfriend_. _artifact_ for
<ce>                you %g will have. Will wait for you for
<ce>                  =1stparton_ days and then will go to
<ce>                marry the unknown heir of Rowanda. Now I
<ce>                     bid you a yapow and gazeenza.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    Excuse me, you don't know this,
<ce>                   but I'm completely mad. And if you
<ce>                  don't shove off, I'll vomit on you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Ah, nice of you to let me out of my
<ce>                 cell, madam jailer. Sheogorath changed
<ce>                 his mind and decided that he wanted to
<ce>                         take =monster_ to tea
<ce>                  after all. But when he found out, %g
<ce>                  was dead, he decided that was best.
<ce>                           That way =monster_
<ce>                 wouldn't eat all the posy pies. Before
<ce>                   I forget, here's _artifact_. Don't
<ce>                            point it at me.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
A mad battlemage is terrorizing the countryside around ___mondung_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>___mondung_ is quiet now that that =monster_ moved on, but %g'll be back,
<ce>                              I'll wager.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Good riddance on the battlemage =monster_ in ___mondung_. I hear %g was mad as a magister.

So, someone finally killed that mad battlemage in ___mondung_. Thank %god.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 The Daedra Prince Sheogorath has
 promised me an artifact called _artifact_
 in exchange for the death of a battlemage
 named =monster_. If this battlemage,
 who resides in a placed called ___mondung_,
 is dead and I meet Sheogorath's contact in
 ___contactdung_, _qgfriend_
 will give me _artifact_. But I have to
 have this all accomplished in =1stparton_ days.

Message:  1030
<ce>                     You have dispatched =monster_
<ce>                    from this mortal plane.  Now to
<ce>                   see if Sheogorath still remembers
<ce>                            your agreement.
