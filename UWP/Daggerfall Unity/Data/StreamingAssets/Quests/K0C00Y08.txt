<ce>                        You've heard of _book_?
<ce>               It is a very rare tome, almost never seen,
<ce>               but I have located a copy buried away in a
<ce>                      dungeon here in %reg. I will
<ce>           give you _upfront_ gold pieces now and _gold_ gold
<ce>                     once the book is in my hands.
<ce>                                Agreed?
                                     <--->
<ce>               I am looking for a very special book, one
<ce>            that is not available in any store, at least not
<ce>           for any price less than astronomical. Recently, I
<ce>           have heard that a copy of it has surfaced not too
<ce>            far from here, in a dungeon. If you will accept
<ce>             this quest to find this tome, I will give you
<ce>           _upfront_ gold pieces now and another _gold_ gold
<ce>                   pieces when you return. Do we have
<ce>                           a deal then, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      Very well. I'll look for a
<ce>                       different mercenary then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Good. I'll give you =queston_ days to get the
<ce>                      book out of ___mondung_ and
<ce>            return. After that time, the _gold_ gold pieces
<ce>                will be forfeit. The name of the book is
<ce>                           _book_. Good luck,
<ce>                                 %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Ah, marvelous. Here's the _gold_
<ce>                 gold pieces I promised. Thank you very
<ce>                              much, %pcf.

I got a boil the other day ... but it healed.
<--->
I just had a three hour conversation about the weather.
<--->
The weather is pretty usual for this time of year.
<--->
It seems a trifle coolish in %cn for this time of year.
<--->
It sure is a lot warmer today than this time last year.
<--->
My great aunt is going to a specialist across the Bay.
<--->
It's always funny what time it gets dark around here.
<--->
We should erect a war statue around here.
<--->
The kids these days with their magic. %oth, I don't know.
<--->
I had the weirdest dream last night.
<--->
I heard a great joke. %jok
<--->
%jok Actually, that's a joke.
<--->
%jok Can you explain that to me?
<--->
The legal system in %reg has good points and bad ones.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_qgiver_ is happy as a harpy about %g3 new acquisition.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
What can I do for you, o %ra who brought me _book_?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                        As _book_ is lost once
<ce>                      again, I find it in dubious
<ce>                      taste that you are bothering
<ce>                          me. Go get stuffed.

 _qgiver_ of
 __qgiver_, ___qgiver_ has
 sent me to ___mondung_ in
 search of _book_,
 a very rare book. I will be given _gold_
 gold pieces if I return in =queston_ days or less.

<ce>                             You picked up
<ce>                                _book_.

Message:  1012
<ce>                           _qgiver_ will be
<ce>                   angry. This is past the time when
