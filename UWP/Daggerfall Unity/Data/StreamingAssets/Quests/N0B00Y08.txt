<ce>                          Noble _warrior_ has
<ce>                  sponsored the Guild in many of our
<ce>                   enterprises, and as we have made
<ce>                   enemies, so has %g. We have word
<ce>                   from %g2 courier that a witch has
<ce>                  cursed %g2 with unending insomnia.
<ce>                    A simple Sleep spell would cure
<ce>                    %g2 -- perhaps you are willing
<ce>                     and able to cast it? I would
<ce>                    willingly pay you _gold_ gold.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   If you are capable of casting the
<ce>                   standard circinate spell Sleep, a
<ce>                    friend of the Guild is in need.
<ce>                          _warrior_ has been
<ce>                     cursed and is in need of that
<ce>                       somniferous spell. I can
<ce>                     offer you _gold_ gold pieces
<ce>                     in exchange for this service.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        I see. %oth, Sleep is a
<ce>                   relatively simple spell. It would
<ce>                   probably do you well to learn it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Very good. Now, I told the courier
<ce>                  that we wouldn't use any spell but
<ce>                          Sleep on _warrior_.
<ce>                  Given %g2 previous experience with
<ce>                  cursed spells, you can hardly blame
<ce>                   %g2 for this anxiety. You'll find
<ce>                         _warrior_ in _castle_
<ce>                        in __castle_. _warrior_
<ce>                   will be the well-armored one. Be
<ce>                 certain to be back in =queston_ days,
<ce>                    with our friend in sound sopor.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                         I hear that _warrior_
<ce>                   dropped into sublime torpescence
<ce>                    right on %g3 feet. I do hope %g
<ce>                  wakes before next New Life. As for
<ce>                         you, my fine %ra, you
<ce>                   have certainly earned your _gold_
<ce>                             gold pieces.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Poor _warrior_ has been awake for days. I think %g2 sanity is going.
<--->
The witch who cursed _warrior_ with sleeplessness really did a job on %g2.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_warrior_ and the Mages Guild are at odds. They couldn't help %g2.
<--->
_warrior_ made peace with the witches, but hasn't forgiven the Mages Guild.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_warrior_ is still sleeping I hear. Now they're afraid %g'll never wake up.
<--->
The witch who cursed _warrior_ has vowed vengeance on the man who cured %g2.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You helped us maintain good relations with _warrior_. What may I do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>               You failed the Guild when you failed our
<ce>                         friend _warrior_. Go
<ce>               from here. Perhaps in time I may forgive
<ce>                              thee, %pcn.

%qdt:
 I have agreed to cast Sleep
 on _warrior_, a patron
 of the Mages Guild of
 ___qgiver_. I have =queston_
 days to get to _castle_
 in __castle_ where
 _warrior_ lives, cast
 the spell successfully, and return
 to _qgiver_ in the
 Mages Guild.

<ce>                            _warrior_ falls
<ce>                     into a profound sleep, still
<ce>                             on %g3 feet.
