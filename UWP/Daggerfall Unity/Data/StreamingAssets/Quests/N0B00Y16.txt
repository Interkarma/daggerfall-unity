QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                   %pct, I need someone who can cast
<ce>                    the Open spell.  Please tell me
<ce>                     you have learned this by now.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Really, you need to devote yourself
<ce>                    to your studies if you expect to
<ce>                         advance in the Guild.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Well, that's a start.  The job I need
<ce>                 you for is quite simple.  Even a child
<ce>                could probably do it, but here you are.
<ce>                  A local merchant, _merchant_, bought
<ce>                an antique chest, but has been unable to
<ce>                  get it open.  The best locksmiths in
<ce>                     __shop_ have tried and failed,
<ce>                so %g has asked us if we can help.  Now,
<ce>              we really don't have time for such trifling
<ce>                  matters, but the Guild could use %g3
<ce>                patronage, so I agreed to send someone.
<ce>                From what I am told, it sounds like one
<ce>                   of _mage_'s trick boxes.  %g made
<ce>                 hundreds of them in %g3 day, mainly as
<ce>                 gifts for %g3 friends, and they still
<ce>               turn up from time to time, as the workman-
<ce>               ship really is outstanding... where was I?
<ce>                Oh yes, well, the secret to these boxes
<ce>               is that they are almost impossible to open
<ce>              in any way except by the use of the simple,
<ce>               standard Open spell.  %g specifically made
<ce>             them resistant to the fancy alternative spells
<ce>              %g3 friends liked to use.  Yes, %g tended to
<ce>              waste %g3 considerable talents on jokes like
<ce>                 this.  A real shame.  Well, run along.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                %pct, leave me in peace and run along.
<ce>                    I have work to do and so do you,
<ce>                          if I'm not mistaken.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Eh?  What do you want?  Oh yes, the
<ce>                   trick box.  I trust it didn't give
<ce>                   you any difficulty.  A little good
<ce>                     publicity for the Mages Guild
<ce>                     and all that rot.  Jolly good.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>        Did you hear about _merchant_?  %g bought an old chest
<ce>                and now %g can't open it.  What a hoot!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>_merchant_ finally gave up on his magic box and sold it to someone else.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>  _merchant_ got the Mages Guild to open %g3 trick box, and it turned
<ce>            out to be empty!  At least that's what I heard.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>        Hullo, %pcn.  I remember you.  _mage_'s magic box, yes?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>         For heaven's sake, what do you want now?  You're the
<ce>      fool that couldn't even open that trick box of _merchant_'s.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of ___questgiver_'s
 Mages Guild has asked me to open
 an old chest for _merchant_,
 a local merchant.  _questgiver_
 believes it is probably a trick
 box that only a standard Open
 spell will open.  I suppose
 I should return to see %g2 when
 I am done.

Message:  1030
<ce>                 The Mages Guild sent you?  Very good.
<ce>                   I knew my old friend _questgiver_
<ce>                   wouldn't let me down.  Here is the
<ce>                   box.  I hope you have some idea of
<ce>                  how to open it.  I'm at my wits end.

Message:  1040
<ce>                  As you cast Open on the chest, the
<ce>                 lid springs open and an imp flies out.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                "Happy birthday, =mage2_ you old fart!"
<ce>                   the imp cackles in an unnaturally
<ce>                          deep gravelly voice.

Message:  1041
<ce>                  You hear the lock click as you cast
<ce>                  Open on the chest.  Inside is a wand
<ce>                  inscribed: "To =mage3_ on your 110th
<ce>                   birthday.  Use me for a preview of
<ce>                         your 120th birthday!"

Message:  1042
<ce>                Smoke pours from the chest as you cast
<ce>               Open on it.  The lid pops open, revealing
<ce>                           an engraved card:
<ce>                                    
 Dear =mage4_,
 
 Hope you like the new place.  Did
 you remember to call the exterminator
 before you moved in?
 
 Your friend,
 
 _mage_

Message:  1043
<ce>                    The lid of the chest pops open.
<ce>                      Inside is nothing but a few
<ce>                       scraps of faded confetti.

Message:  1050
<ce>                    Tell _questgiver_ I appreciate
<ce>                   %g2 sending you to help...I guess.
<ce>                     Of course, if I had known what
<ce>                      was inside, I might not have
<ce>                       been so eager to open it!

Message:  1051
<ce>                     If you can't open it, you may
<ce>                        as well keep it.  I have
<ce>                         no use for it anymore.
