QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              You dare summon forth Azura of the Crimson
<ce>               Gate, pleading for power? I don't know if
<ce>                you are worthy of such favor. In fact, I
<ce>                doubt it very much. I suppose that if I
<ce>               demanded that you murder a priest who has
<ce>                been saying very, very rude things about
<ce>                 me, you would refuse even that small,
<ce>               simple request. Would you do that for me?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                No! You're supposed to say yes! You're
<ce>                 supposed to say: Yes, beautiful Azura,
<ce>                  I would gladly murder at the snap of
<ce>                          your ivory fingers.
<ce>                                 Boor!
<ce>                                 Bigot!
<ce>                               Barbarian!
<ce>                        Now, I must go before I
<ce>                    forget that I am a lady and say
<ce>                     something that I'll regret ...

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 You would! Oh jolly good. Well, this
<ce>                perfectly awful priest is also a Healer,
<ce>                if that means anything. Isn't that just
<ce>              typical?  As usual with these self-righteous
<ce>                      types, =monster_ is secluded
<ce>                       in ___mondung_, cleansing
<ce>                or some such ridiculous thing.  Anyway,
<ce>               why don't you hop on over there and stick
<ce>                 a sword in %g2 or something. And then
<ce>                      scurry over to ___qgfriend_
<ce>                   and see my dear darling _qgfriend_
<ce>                who will give you my Star. That's enough
<ce>               power for anyone. I think =1stparton_ days
<ce>                is time enough for this, don't you? Oh,
<ce>                   good. Hurry along then, %pcf. And
<ce>                     don't be a stranger. Say hi to
<ce>                     _qgfriend_ for me. Okay, 'bye.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                              Hmm? What?
<ce>                             Do I know you?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                          Oh. Oh, %pcn! Have
<ce>                  you been here long? I'm sorry, I was
<ce>                  just day-dreaming about my mistress,
<ce>                  the Lady Azura. That candle reminded
<ce>                  me of the scintillation of her eyes,
<ce>                 you see. How silly of me. Well, here's
<ce>                  _artifact_. She doesn't give this to
<ce>                  just anyone, but don't let it go to
<ce>                     your bean. She was mine first.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Did you hear =monster_'s speech about the sin of vanity when %g came to town?
<--->
If you talk to =monster_, you'll recognize how egotism is the worst of sins.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
=monster_ has moved on, but %g3 message about the virtues of humility remain.
<--->
=monster_ has left %reg, still spreading %g3 messages about vanity, I hear.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
It's not a real tragedy about =monster_ -- I mean, %g was a real goody-goody.
<--->
<ce>I'm not glad =monster_'s dead, but %g3 message was ... well, rather extreme
 don't you think?

Message:  1011
_qgfriend_ is that =qgfriend_ I saw daydreaming at __qgfriend_ to the %di.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is that sleepy-eyed =qgfriend_ in __qgfriend_, %di of here.

Message:  1012
_qgfriend_ is one of the Lady Azura's lovers and an agent of hers in %reg.
<--->
_qgfriend_ is a =qgfriend_ who Lady Azura has bewitched into a virtual slave.

Message:  1013
Azura is one of the Daedric Regents of Oblivion. Her sphere is vanity.
<--->
Lady Azura is the Daedra Prince of Vanity and Egotism.

Message:  1014
_artifact_ can transform living creatures into statues forever.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I have an arrangement with one of the
 Daedra Princes, Azura. If I will slay a
 monk who lives in a deserted temple,
 ___mondung_, and meet her contact,
 _qgfriend_ of ___qgfriend_
 within =1stparton_ days, I will be given
 _artifact_.

Message:  1030
<ce>                     You have killed the _monster_
<ce>                   =monster_, as you promised Azura.
