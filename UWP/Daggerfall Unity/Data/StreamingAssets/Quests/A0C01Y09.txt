QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                   Excuse me? _questg_ is the name.
<ce>                   I don't know how I feel about you,
<ce>              but I do need a favor. My sister, _sister_,
<ce>              is having a birthday next month and I could
<ce>              really use some _item_ for the celebration.
<ce>            It's worth _gold_ gold pieces. What do you say?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Just as well, I suppose. Good day.
                                     <--->
<ce>                            Sorry I asked.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Then we never talked. I'd hate for
<ce>                       you to spoil the surprise.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 Whatever. It was easy gold, you know.
                                     <--->
<ce>             Leave me then. I have a celebration to plan.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Excellent! You are a smart one.
<ce>                    This is easy gold. Go to _store_
<ce>                and find _merchant_. %g has the specific
<ce>                   _item_ I need. Remember, there is
<ce>                   only a month 'til the celebration.
                                     <--->
<ce>          Very good. This is easy gold. You'll have to go to
<ce>                 _store_ to find the exact kind I need.
<ce>                 Talk to _merchant_. %g runs the place.


QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Very good, %pcn. Here's the gold I promised.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                  I hear that _questg_ really doesn't
<ce>                  like %g3 sister, _sister_. And %g is
<ce>                         about to get married.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                 Did you hear that _sister_ uncovered
<ce>                       an attempt to poison %g2?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                     _sister_ was found dead! And
<ce>                   on the eve of %g3 wedding day, too.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                 Ahem. Well, yes. I suppose since you
<ce>                  did get that... item for my sister's
<ce>                     nuptials, I do owe you a debt.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 Traitor! I send you on a simple fetch
<ce>                   mission and you have to blab it to
<ce>                 _sister_. You'll get no help from me.


Message:  1011
<ce>                     You are carrying the _item_.
<ce>                  Do you want to give it to _sister_?

Message:  1013
<ce>                     You are carrying the _item_.
<ce>                       Do you want to give it to
<ce>                               _questg_?

Message:  1025
%qdt:
 I have promised _questg_ of ___questg_
 that I will obtain some _item_ from
 _merchant_ at _store_
 in return for _gold_ gold pieces. I must return with
 the _item_ before the birthday celebration
 of _questg_'s sister, _sister_,
 which is in one month.

Message:  1040
<ce>                     Hello. Yes, I am _merchant_.
<ce>               Some _item_? Yes, I have it. I'll take your
<ce>              20 gold pieces and you can have the _item_.
<ce>                        Thanks for stopping by.

Message:  1041
<ce>                     Hello. Yes, I am _merchant_.
<ce>               Some _item_? Yes, I have it. I'll take your
<ce>              20 gold pieces and you can have the _item_.
<ce>             Oh, I'm sorry. You don't seem to have enough
<ce>                         gold to pay for that.

Message:  1050
<ce>                   Hello? Why are you here? You say
<ce>                       _questg_ wants some _item_
<ce>           for my birthday celebration? Oh, what a wonderful
<ce>               idea! I promise not to spoil the surprise!

Message:  1051
<ce>                 Hello? How did you get in here? What?
<ce>                  _questg_ asked you to bring %g2 some
<ce>                 _item_? Oh my... do you have any idea
<ce>                   what he plans to do with it? I do.
<ce>                    _item_ is part of a potion that
<ce>               my loving brother likes to make. A potion
<ce>                that kills. You must not give it to %g2!
<ce>                    Please! Bring the _item_ to me.
<ce>                 You must do this or I may be killed!

Message:  1060
<ce>                        I'll take it, I guess.
<ce>                  But doesn't this ruin the surprise?
<ce>                      You are a strange one, %pcn.

Message:  1061
<ce>                     Thank you. My brother cannot
<ce>                    use it now. You have done well.
<ce>                               Thank you.
