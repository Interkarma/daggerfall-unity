QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                      We would use thee to find
<ce>                  a perfidious document circulated by
<ce>                  our enemies in an effort to suppress
<ce>                 our coven. I know wherein this packet
<ce>                  of printed lies has been placed, but
<ce>                   we need someone like thee to fight
<ce>                   its guardian and bring it us. Wilt
<ce>                      thou assist ==qgiver_ thus?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                         Wilt thou not? %oth,
<ce>                      then do not ask for favor of
<ce>                               ==qgiver_.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Wilt thou? Then you will have our
<ce>                most unconfuted gratitude. The document
<ce>                    lies in a temple, here in %reg,
<ce>                      in a town called __temple_.
<ce>                      _temple_ keeps it somewhere,
<ce>                perhaps behind locked doors, guarded by
<ce>                  a _guardian_ of unquestioned power.
<ce>                If thou wilt bring the document here, to
<ce>                   me, I will give to thee a _mitem_
<ce>                of the coven's manufacture. Return in no
<ce>                       later than =queston_ days.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Ah, the accursed document. Thou art
<ce>                 to be commended for thy service to our
<ce>                     sisterhood, %pct. Here is the
<ce>                        _mitem_ I promised thee.
<ce>                    The gratitude of ==qgiver_ need
<ce>                      not be physical to be felt.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Have you read the next History of ==qgiver_. Shocking!

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The History of ==qgiver_ is being reproduced in the Imperial City.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Some have read the History of ==qgiver_, but the only copy disappeared.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Art thou pleased with thy _mitem_, %pcf? Thou surely didst deserve it.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      The accursed document hath
<ce>                    gone to the Imperial City to be
<ce>                      reproduced for the ignorant
<ce>                           masses, %pcf. Thou
<ce>                         hast failed ==qgiver_.
<ce>                          Go from this place.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 I have agreed to get a document
 about ==qgiver_ from _temple_
 in __temple_ and return with it
 in =queston_ days or less. The document
 will likely be guarded by a _guardian_.

Message:  1011
<ce>                    This is apparently the document
<ce>                         that ==qgiver_ wanted.

Message:  1012
Among the more fiendish practices of the
 ==qgiver_ is the rite they
 perform in honor of ==daedra_.
 The flesh of a newborn infant is boiled over
 the flames of burning brimstone for three and
 a half days until it is hard and leathery.
 The resultant fiber is sewn over the head of
 a black cat, who is kept in a cage until it
 has chewed through the caul or has died of
 suffocation. If the cat dies, the witches
 know that ==daedra_ will
 not answer their entreaties, but if the cat
 lives, ==qgiver_ may ask
 ==daedra_ for anything -- the
 death or mutilation of princes, economic
 catastrophe, famine, plague, war ...

Message:  1013
<ce>                     Pawn of the Fiends! Slave of
<ce>                           the ==qgiver_! The
<ce>                         Righteous Hand of %god
<ce>                            will smite thee!
