<ce>                       As you know, %pct, there
<ce>                     is no room for failure in the
<ce>                    Dark Brotherhood. Brothers who
<ce>                     fail us are targeted for an
<ce>                     accounting. You will find and
<ce>                        correct one such errant
<ce>                            former member.
                                     <--->
<ce>                    It is a solemn duty, and not an
<ce>                     entirely disagreeable one, to
<ce>                   account agents of the Brotherhood
<ce>                       who have failed us in an
<ce>                     assignment. You are, I trust,
<ce>                        free to take on such an
<ce>                              assignment?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       Did I hear you correctly?
<ce>                          %pct, I am grieved
<ce>                      by your lack of cooperation
<ce>                          with your brothers.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                           Very good, %pct.
<ce>                       =target_, having learned
<ce>                  something during %g3 tenure in the
<ce>                Brotherhood, has wisely hidden %g2self,
<ce>                  but we have a contact in __snitch_,
<ce>                 a miserable =snitch_ named _snitch_.
<ce>                    Talk to %g2 and get =target_'s
<ce>               location. I will expect the accounting to
<ce>                  be accomplished, and you to be back
<ce>                        here in =queston_ days.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                           Well done, %pct.
<ce>                    A good lesson for all who might
<ce>                         fail the Brotherhood.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
=target_ is at large somewhere in %reg, shaking like a willow, I wager.
<--->
=target_ was a pretty decent assassin. Not good enough, it seems.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Apparently you can beat the Brotherhood. Witness =target_, for example.
<--->
=target_ is really thumbing %g3 nose at the Dark Brotherhood.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
=target_, they say %g failed the Brotherhood once. And that was %g3 reward.
<--->
The Dark Brotherhood tolerates no failure. Look what happened to poor =target_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hello, %pcn. How may I assist you who slew our errant brother?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 Let me understand this. I sent you to
<ce>                     account a _target_ who failed
<ce>                the Brotherhood and ... you failed. And
<ce>                 now, you want to chat. Unbelievable.

%qdt:
 The Dark Brotherhood in ___qgiver_
 has sent me to a Brother who failed an
 assigment. I am to talk to a squealer
 named _snitch_ in __snitch_
 of ___snitch_ who will tell
 me whither =target_ has fled.

Message:  1011
<ce>                          %pcn? I'm _snitch_.
<ce>                 The fish you're after has slipped the
<ce>                 hook and is living a fancy life down
<ce>                         in ___mondung_. Just
<ce>                         watch yourself, %ra.
<ce>                      =target_ knows how to fight
<ce>                           and %g's scared.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
 _snitch_ tells me that =target_
 is in ___mondung_.

Message:  1013
<ce>                       You have slain =target_.
<ce>                   The Brotherhood will be pleased.
