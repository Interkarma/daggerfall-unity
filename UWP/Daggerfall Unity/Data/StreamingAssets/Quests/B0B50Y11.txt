<ce>                            I am _qgiver_.
<ce>                        One of the local nobles,
<ce>                      _nobleman_, has just gotten
<ce>                        the deed to an abandoned
<ce>                      piece of property. Too late,
<ce>                      %g found out it is haunted.
<ce>                      Someone needs to go out and
<ce>                      banish the ghost that haunts
<ce>                      it. Are you willing to take
<ce>                             up this quest?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        Ghosts are normally the
<ce>                      temple's problem. Maybe I'll
<ce>                      turn this one over to them.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       _nobleman_ wants to begin
<ce>                    rebuilding within =2dung_ days.
<ce>                    %g has the deed to ___dungeon_,
<ce>                     where you'll find the spirit.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       _nobleman_ will be quite
<ce>                      pleased. %g has even offered
<ce>                       to dedicate a fountain in
<ce>                               your name.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_nobleman_ was crazy to accept the deed to ___dungeon_. Crazy or stupid.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Poor _nobleman_ appealed to %kno to exorcise ___dungeon_, but they failed.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
___dungeon_ can be made into a warehouse or a summer home, thanks to %kno.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Greetings, %pcf. After helping us with _nobleman_, what can I do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You failed %kno when you failed _nobleman_, %pcf. A grave disappointment.

 _qgiver_ of
 ==qgiver_ in ___qgiver_

 it. I have =2dung_ days before
 they they need to begin
 the reconstruction.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      The ghost has been laid to
<ce>                        rest. _nobleman_ can now
<ce>                          rebuild ___dungeon_.
