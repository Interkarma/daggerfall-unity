<ce>                 Every once in a while we get an idiot
<ce>                 like this client. Some fool left his
<ce>               back door open and a wild animal got in.
<ce>                He seems rather confused as to whether
<ce>                it is a bear or a tiger, but in either
<ce>                  case, it wanted to eat him. We need
<ce>                  you to go and slay the animal. Your
<ce>                     standard fee is _gold_ gold.
<ce>                         Want to take it %pcn?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Gotcha. Let the tiger have him. The
<ce>                  guy is a fool for letting it in in
<ce>                         the first place, eh?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     Great. Go over to _house_ in
<ce>                    __house_. I'll give you =2dung_
<ce>                  days to kill it and get back to me.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        No great difficulties I
<ce>                      trust? Thought not. Here's
<ce>                           your _gold_ gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                   I hear there's a tiger trapped in
<ce>                      _house_. He's going to have
<ce>                        to pay to get it slain.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
A tiger killed some poor bloke in his own home. A terrible tragedy.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Didn't you kill that rampaging tiger that got into _house_?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Good going with that tiger.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Tigers are tough. Maybe we should start you out with chipmunks. What a putz.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ in ___qgiver_ gave
 me the job of killing a tiger or bear
 that got into _house_
 in __house_. If I get back
 to him within =2dung_ days I get
 _gold_ gold pieces.

Message:  1011
<ce>                        The _monster_ is dead.

Message:  1012
<ce>                          The _bear_ is dead.

Message:  1080
<ce>                      Hey, I just remembered, one
<ce>                       of the members just found
<ce>                       this map to ___newdung_.
<ce>                   Don't kill everything in one day.
