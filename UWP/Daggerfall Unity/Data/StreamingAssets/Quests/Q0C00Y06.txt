QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  We have a potential problem I fear.
<ce>                 A vampire ancient hateful of witches
<ce>                  hath moved into an abandoned castle
<ce>                  in our territory. Obviously this is
<ce>                   a situation we must remedy, doth
<ce>                           thou agree, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    I can understand thy fear. Only
<ce>                   the very able or the very foolish
<ce>                    would agree to slay a vampiric
<ce>                               ancient.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Wouldst thou? And yet, a vampiric
<ce>                    ancient is no feeble adversary.
<ce>                     Do not go into battle without
<ce>                     preparation. This creature is
<ce>                          called =vamprival_,
<ce>                    and its new sanctuary is called
<ce>                    ___mondung_. Thou wilt find it
<ce>                           in ____mondung_.
<ce>                     I will expect ye back here in
<ce>                      =1stparton_ nights. Do not
<ce>                       get thyself killed, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      Perhaps you were hoping for
<ce>                            =vamprival_ to
<ce>                       commit suicide? Unlikely.
<ce>                       You must be the agent of
<ce>                              %g3 death.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  We could almost hear the screams of
<ce>                     that ancient from here, %pcf.
<ce>                   Thou hast the witches' gratitude.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There's been a lot of activity at ___mondung_, but it's been abandoned for years.
<--->
That =vamprival_ is an aristocrat. Says %g's cleaning up ___mondung_ and %reg.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
=vamprival_ finally moved out of ___mondung_, I hear. No place for an aristocrat.
<--->
Now that =vamprival_ moved out of ___mondung_, %g's over at the palace a lot.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
It turns out that nice =vamprival_ was a vampire! I had no idea!
<--->
Thank %god that wonderful %ra mercenary killed the vampire in ___mondung_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
We have not forgot =vamprival_, %pcf. What may we do for thee?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                        =vamprival_ still walks
<ce>                  the night, feeding on our sisters.
<ce>                    Thou should have said that thou
<ce>                    could not defeat it. Go from us
<ce>                   now. We would not speak further.

Message:  1011
_witch_ is a very nice and intelligent =witch_ at __witch_.
<--->
_witch_ is that nice =witch_ you'll find at __witch_, %di of here.

Message:  1012
_witch_ is a witch of ___witch_.
<--->
_witch_ is a ___witch_ witch, a =witch_.

Message:  1015
%qdt:
 _witch_ of
 ___witch_ has sent me to slay
 a vampire ancient bent on the destruction
 of the witches of %reg. I
 have promised to have the undead creature
 in ___mondung_ permanently dead in
 =1stparton_ days and be back in ___witch_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                      You have slain =vamprival_.
