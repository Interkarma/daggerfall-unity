<ce>                Is that a hint of sorrow on your brow,
<ce>                       %pcf? I quite understand.
<ce>                 I have on more than on occasion had to
<ce>                slay an offspring of mine. You must try
<ce>                to rise above this mawkish mortal regard
<ce>                 for propagation. What you have had to
<ce>                  do is lamentable, but you must chill
<ce>                your blood to truly become one of %vam.
<ce>                 You have made a step toward that, for
<ce>                   which you deserve congratulations.

I got a boil the other day ... but it healed.
<--->
I just had a three hour conversation about the weather.
<--->
The weather is pretty usual for this time of year.
<--->
It seems a trifle coolish in %cn for this time of year.
<--->
It sure is a lot warmer today than this time last year.
<--->
My great aunt is going to a specialist across the Bay.
<--->
It's always funny what time it gets dark around here.
<--->
We should erect a war statue around here.
<--->
The kids these days with their magic. %oth, I don't know.
<--->
I had the weirdest dream last night.
<--->
I heard a great joke. %jok
<--->
%jok Actually, that's a joke.
<--->
%jok Can you explain that to me?
<--->
The legal system in %reg has its good points and bad ones.

 My Dear %pcn,
 
      Perhaps you remember a warrior
 you met once, =vampire_?  Taut,
 succulent, slightly thin-blooded,
 but all in all, a memorable meal. Well,
 %g's back from the grave now.
 
      %vam have rather
 mixed emotions about your progeny's
 existence. Come see me and we'll discuss
 it.
 
 
                    Yours in Death,
 
                    _vamp_

<ce>                    A pale young boy slips a letter
<ce>                     into your hand and disappears,
<ce>                            nimble as a rat.

 _vamp_ of %vam sent
 me a letter, asking for my
 immediate presence in ___vamp_
 at a place called __vamp_.

Message:  1013
<ce>              Ah, good evening to you, blood of my blood.
<ce>               We have a problem, you and I. One of your
<ce>               old meals has come back out of the grave.
<ce>                  =vampire_? I don't know if the name
<ce>                 means anything to you. In any case, we
<ce>                 have been watching %g2, as we watched
<ce>               you, to see if %g3 response to immortality
<ce>                      is worthy of %g3 bloodline.
<ce>               It has not been. With every drop of blood
<ce>                %g drinks, %g3 thirst increases tenfold.
<ce>               A mad, virgin vampire loose in the region
<ce>                 is a threat to all civilized vampiric
<ce>                      business. Go to ___mondung_
<ce>               and slay this troublesome child of yours.
<ce>                  It is unpleasant business, but it is
<ce>                   your responsibility. I will expect
<ce>                  to see you again in =queston_ nights
<ce>                   with the deed completed. Farewell.

 _vamp_ has sent me to
 ___mondung_ where
 I am to slay =vampire_, a
 vampire I created. I have
 =queston_ nights to do
 this duty and report back to
 ___vamp_.

<ce>                     Better not spare that rod, my
<ce>                        parent. You'll spoil me.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     I know you. You were the last
<ce>                      face I saw, smeared with the
<ce>                    blood of my body. Come, my dear
<ce>                        creator, let us embrace.
                                     <--->
<ce>                      Your face is the face of my
<ce>                          nightmare, %pcn. You
<ce>                      are the one who cursed me to
<ce>                         this life, aren't you?

<ce>                            =vampire_ dies
<ce>                         at last a true death.
<ce>                        You must return to tell
<ce>                            _vamp_ that the
<ce>                             deed is done.
