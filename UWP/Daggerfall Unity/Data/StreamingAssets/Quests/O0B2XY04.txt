<ce>                     I have a job. Ordinary guild
<ce>                   work. Worth _gold_ gold. Just the
<ce>                    standard guild fee. Interested?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        Too bad for you, %pcn.

<ce>                           Go to __mansion_.
<ce>                            Find _mansion_.
<ce>                    Inside is a rare book, entitled
<ce>                         _book_. Bring it back
<ce>                    to me within =traveltime_ days,
<ce>                        and I'll pay you. Simple
<ce>                              enough, eh?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        Ah. %oth. Here is your
<ce>                      guild fee. Maybe some day we
<ce>                        can work together again.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
A collector in __mansion_ just bought a rare copy of _book_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The security in _mansion_ wasn't great, so they moved the valuables out.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
That copy of _book_ that was stolen from _mansion_ was irreplaceable.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Oh, hello, %pcf. Good work on getting that book, if I didn't mention it before.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                    Don't fumble for excuses, %pcf.
<ce>               I told you where to find the book and told
<ce>                 you to hurry, but you didn't. Now it's
<ce>                  too late, and I'm tired. Just, be a
<ce>                    good %ra and sod off, will you?
