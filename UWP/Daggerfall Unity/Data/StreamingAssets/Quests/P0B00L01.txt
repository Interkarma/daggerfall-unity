QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                                Do you
<ce>                         have a few nights free
<ce>                               for %vam?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      No was not the answer I was
<ce>                     anticipating. Try to make some
<ce>                        time and effort for %vam
<ce>                       in the future, whelp. You
<ce>                          would not like being
<ce>                               abandoned.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      %pcf, I need you to deliver
<ce>                      a letter to an ally of %vam.
<ce>               _pawn_ will wait for you for no more than
<ce>                    =1stparton_ nights at __pawn_ in
<ce>                 ___pawn_. Do not miss the appointment.
<ce>           I will expect you back here in =1stparton_ nights.
<ce>                                Goodbye.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                         Until my letter is in
<ce>                            _pawn_'s sweaty
<ce>                       hands, I'm not interested
<ce>                           in talking, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Thank you for delivering that letter
<ce>                    so promptly, %pcf. It was rather
<ce>                   important. I have also been busy.
<ce>                      Take this _reward_ as a gift
<ce>                          for a job well done.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That =pawn_ in __pawn_ is waiting for someone. Someone who's arriving at night.
<--->
They say the %t is finally going to do something about the vampire menace.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
That nervous =pawn_ finally left __pawn_. Must've missed %g3 nighttime meeting.
<--->
That =vampire_ in __vampire_ was muttering about that %ra %g's always with.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
The %rt apparently changed %g3 mind about the existence of vampires in %reg.
<--->
The %rt was going to put more guards out at night, but changed %g3 mind.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Salutations, %pcf. I hope _pawn_ was sufficiently polite to you.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      When I sent you to _pawn_,
<ce>                   I expected you to go to %g2, %pcf.
<ce>                        Don't ... make me angry.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                        Yes, my name is _pawn_.
<ce>                          Y-you must be %pcn.
<ce>                          Tell _vampire_ that
<ce>                   I'll take care of everything. Make
<ce>                   sure %g knows I'm loyal. Nothing's
<ce>                     changed. Thank you. I'll make
<ce>                        sure everything's fine.

Message:  1011
_vampire_?  A very charming =vampire_ who stays at __vampire_, I believe.
<--->
_vampire_ is that =vampire_ at __vampire_.

Message:  1012
_vampire_ is one of %vam vampires.
<--->
_vampire_ is a mentor, a fairly young member of %vam bloodline.

Message:  1013
_pawn_,
 
   We have heard that once again the %t
 is considering increasing the number of
 patrols in %reg during the night
 to combat the unexplained attacks. %t
 %rt will be receiving a visitor
 from %vam so this situation will
 be reasonably resolved.
   Please assist in this matter as per
 the usual plan. %vam are not
 amused that we must continually address
 this same potential problem.
   The %t's family has grown quite
 healthy incidentally. Not a coincidence.
 Or a situation without a remedy.
 
<ce>                              -- _vampire_

Message:  1014
_pawn_ is a nervous =pawn_ at __pawn_, %di of here.
<--->
_pawn_ is the name of that =pawn_ I saw at __pawn_. That's to the %di.

Message:  1015
_pawn_ is a pawn of %vam vampires, who operates out of __pawn_.
<--->
That =pawn_ is an ally of %vam vampires -- %g lives at __pawn_.

Message:  1020
%pcn,
    %vam summon you
 to ___vampire_. Look for
 me there and present this
 letter.
 
 With dying breath,
<ce>                               _vampire_

Message:  1021
<ce>                      You have received a letter.

Message:  1025
%qdt:
 _vampire_ of %vam in
 __vampire_, ___vampire_
 has sent me to bring a letter
 to some sort of =pawn_ in
 ___pawn_ with the unfortunate
 name of _pawn_. It is apparently
 of great importance that I meet %g2
 at __pawn_ no later than =1stparton_
 nights from now.

Message:  1026
%qdt:
 _vampire_ of ___vampire_
 has summoned me to __vampire_
 on %vam business.
