QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  This could be a tough one, even for
<ce>                    you %pcf. It's one of the best
<ce>                     fighters in all of %reg. Are
<ce>                      you sure you want this job?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Don't blame you a bit. This could
<ce>                        be a bit too dangerous.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Somehow I thought you might try for
<ce>     this one. It's your funeral. This mark is no arena gladiator.
<ce>                   We're talking about a veteran of
<ce>                 the Betony war. Killed 9 men, if the
<ce>                  stories are right. Go to _mondung_
<ce>                     in ___mondung_. You'll be able
<ce>                  to identify the mark easily because
<ce>                   of the limp. A spear in the knee
<ce>                  during the war caused it. Get back
<ce>                       here in =1stparton_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   I don't know who you think you've
<ce>                   killed, but it wasn't the target.
<ce>                      Get back to ___mondung_ and
<ce>                  finish what we were contracted for.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    What a battle! I heard about it
<ce>                 already. Street gossip is faster than
<ce>              a horse you know. Here's the _reward_ gold
<ce>                       pieces for the job, %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Such a shame, what's happening in Daggerfall.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I hear the queen is pregnant. At least that's what everyone is saying.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Did you hear about that war hero? Killed in a duel. What a shame.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You battle with that war hero is still being told %pcn.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You failed in your contract to kill the war hero. The brotherhood never forgets failure.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 My contract for the Dark Brotherhood
 in ___questgiver_ is a war hero at _mondung_,
 in ___mondung_. The deed must be
 done in =1stparton_ days.

Message:  1021
<ce>                 "You have succeeded...where all...the
<ce>               soldiers in the...war of Betony failed."
<ce>                                    
<ce>                   The contract has been fulfilled.

Message:  1022
<ce>                   "Do not think me a cripple, just
<ce>                   because I have a limp. I'll still
<ce>                       tear you limb from limb!"

Message:  1023
<ce>                   This isn't a man! It's a vampire!
