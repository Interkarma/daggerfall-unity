QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 I need someone to bring an item to a
<ce>                    contact of mine in ___contact_.
<ce>               You will receive an item in return. If you
<ce>              bring that item back to me, I will happy to
<ce>                 reward you with _reward_ gold pieces.
<ce>                             Do you agree?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                No? What a shame. I was prepared to be
<ce>                            quite generous.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Very good. Take this bar of gold
<ce>                  and bring it to a certain =contact_
<ce>                   called _contact_ in a place called
<ce>                       __contact_ in ___contact_.
<ce>             You will need to move quickly. If you are not
<ce>                   at __contact_ in =1stparton_ days,
<ce>                       _contact_ will leave, and
<ce>               none of us will be happy. Especially you.
<ce>                   Very well, good luck to you, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                You either haven't started yet or else
<ce>              you've come to apologize your failure. Have
<ce>                      you, %pcf? Well, I am indeed
<ce>                disappointed, gravely disappointed. Your
<ce>               ineptitude has complicated matters. Well,
<ce>              I suppose I'll know better next time, shan't
<ce>                      I? Get a move on, %pcf. Now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Excellent, %pcf, you've returned
<ce>                   with my _item2_ as promised. Your
<ce>             valor and bravery are great indeed. I am sure
<ce>             we will appreciate your further service in the
<ce>                        near future. Thank you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>   There was this =contact_ here recently asking if I'd seen a %ra.
                                     <--->
<ce>   Some =contact_ was looking for a %ra with a _item1_ a while back.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>              Well, _questgiver_ is, I've heard, furious
<ce>                         at some %ra mercenary.
                                     <--->
<ce>             _questgiver_ is still relying on mercenaries
<ce>                    and I've heard %g's been burned.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>               I hear that _questgiver_ finally got some
<ce>                           _item2_ %g needed.
                                     <--->
<ce>        _questgiver_ has been singing the praises of a certain
<ce>                             %ra mercenary.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hello again, my young friend. I haven't forgotten your services.
<--->
Ah, %pcf. It's a pleasure to see you again.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                       Why, it's the inept %ra.
<ce>               You have a lot of nerve coming back here.
                                     <--->
<ce>                      Well, if it isn't the inept
<ce>                      courier. Why don't you crawl
<ce>                             away now, hmm?

%qdt:
_questgiver_
 of ___questgiver_ sent me to a
 contact _contact_ of ___contact_
 to deliver a bar of gold to this
 =contact_'s base in __contact_.
 The gold needs to be in %g3 hands in
 =1stparton_ days for me to get my due
 reward.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
I delivered the gold to
 _contact_, who gave me a _item2_
 to take back to _questgiver_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                      That gold bar must be quite
<ce>                       heavy. How about I relieve
<ce>                      you of it? Just hand it over
<ce>                          and I'll let you go.

Message:  1021
<ce>                     Such a brave little courier.
<ce>                      I'll be sure to tell all my
<ce>                      friends how helpful you can
<ce>                              be to them.

Message:  1030
<ce>                     Ah, you must be the courier.
<ce>                    Excellent, excellent.  Now, take
<ce>                   this _item2_ back to _questgiver_
<ce>            immediately, and %g will reward you as promised.
<ce>                  A pleasure doing business with you,
<ce>                                 %pcf!
