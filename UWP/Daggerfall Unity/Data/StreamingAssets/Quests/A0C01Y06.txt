QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                         My name is _qgiver_.
<ce>                My master has asked me to find a brave
<ce>                 adventurer for a dangerous mission. I
<ce>                cannot tell you more, other than to say
<ce>                that it is worth _gold_ gold pieces to
<ce>                 whoever succeeds. Are you interested?
                                     <--->
<ce>                   Call me _qgiver_. I know someone
<ce>                 that may have some work of interest.
<ce>                 There's _gold_ gold in it for whoever
<ce>                            can do the job.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   I shall seek elsewhere for a hero
<ce>                     to fulfill my master's quest.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Go to _meetingplace_. There you
<ce>                    will find my master, _master_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Ask for _master_ in _meetingplace_
<ce>                    and %g will have a job for you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 =mmaster_ is dead.  Your enemies will
<ce>                  think twice before attempting such
<ce>                           treachery again.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                I heard that an orc was spotted in town
<ce>                     today. I hope they catch him.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                  Did you hear the one about the %ra
<ce>                 that got teleported to the bottom of
<ce>               a dungeon? It's really funny! Oh. Sorry.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                   Hey! You're that %ra that killed
<ce>                   the orc witch doctor! Good work!

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                Ok, Ok. I guess I owe you one for that
<ce>             incident with the orc shaman. He was magicked
<ce>                      to look like a regular guy.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 Just stay away! I didn't mean to get
<ce>              anyone hurt. That orc was magicked to look
<ce>               like a regular guy. It's not my fault he
<ce>                    teleported you into a dungeon.

%qdt:
 I met _qgiver_ in ___qgiver_,
 who told me %g3 master,
 _master_, would pay _gold_ gold
 pieces for an unknown but certainly
 dangerous task. %g1 is staying in
 _meetingplace_ in __meetingplace_.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 The traitor =mmaster_, disguised as
 _master_, magicked me
 to ___dungeon_. If I ever
 get out, %g will regret our next meeting.

Message:  1012
<ce>                Know me for who I really am. I am your
<ce>                   mortal enemy, =mmaster_! I have a
<ce>                    special fate in store for you.

Message:  1013
<ce>                    Don't hurt me, %pcn! I didn't
<ce>               know what _master_ was planning. I ain't
<ce>               got no beef with you, honest. %g didn't
<ce>                   tell me nothin', I swear, %g just
<ce>                 paid me to send you to %g2. It's %g2
<ce>                   you want, not me, right? I hear
<ce>                     %g's moved to __hidingplace_.
<ce>                          Look for %g2 there.

Message:  1014
<ce>                   I don't know how you escaped from
<ce>                   ___dungeon_, %pcf. It won't do you
<ce>                   much good, though. Prepare to die!

Message:  1020
<ce>                   _master_? No, I don't think %g's
<ce>                           from around here.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   _master_ is new in town. I'm not
<ce>                         sure where %g's from.

Message:  1021
<ce>                 _master_ has been asking around about
<ce>                               some %ra.
                                     <--->
<ce>               _master_ is staying here in town. I hear
<ce>               %g's been asking a lot of questions about
<ce>               a %ra. You're a %ra, aren't you? Maybe
<ce>                        %g was looking for you?

%qdt:

 is now hiding out in __hidingplace_.

The orc shaman's chanting rises.
