<ce>          Rather embarrassing, but one of our experiments has
<ce>           prematurely evacuated our laboratory. Even worse,
<ce>              it left before it was fed so it's doubtless
<ce>             going to be ill-tempered. Thankfully, it is a
<ce>             disposable creature, a common atronach. On the
<ce>                other hand, we certainly do not need our
<ce>              reputation sullied by a maddened atronach's
<ce>               rampage. If you'd be willing to track the
<ce>               sad beast down and put it out of its, and
<ce>             our, misery, we could offer you, say, _reward_
<ce>                      gold in return. Interested?
                                     <--->
<ce>               Actually, we have had a bit of excitement
<ce>               in this dull old place lately. In a rather
<ce>              routine atronachy class, one of the subjects
<ce>                managed to ... well, the details are not
<ce>                 important. What is, is that there's an
<ce>                     atronach on the loose in %reg
<ce>              that can easily be traced back to this Guild
<ce>               and our maladministration. You're the type
<ce>                   who could end this affair with the
<ce>                     minimum of embarrassment, yes?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               A pity indeed. Well, I suppose some other
<ce>                    fervent adventurer will aid us.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  You will? %oth, what a relief. The
<ce>               miserable creature has apparently taken up
<ce>               residence in a nasty little hole they call
<ce>                   ___mondung_. For our reputation's
<ce>                sake, it is essential that this be done
<ce>                 quickly and quietly, so if you're not
<ce>              able to dispatch the atronach in =1stparton_
<ce>                days, don't bother coming back for your
<ce>                           reward. Good day.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 Am I wearing a silly hat and grinning
<ce>                inanely? No? Then why do you take me for
<ce>                  a fool? I'm perfectly aware that the
<ce>                  atronach still lives. In the future,
<ce>                 do not ask for jobs you are unable or
<ce>                         unwilling to fulfill.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              The hunter returns! You have saved us some
<ce>                  considerable discomfiture with your
<ce>                precipitate amelioration of our atronach
<ce>                 crisis. A first-rate job, all around.
<ce>                   Accept your gold and my gratitude.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I hear something escaped from the Mages Guild lab the other night.
<--->
%oth, I saw a shape skulking in the shadows right about then.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Well, there's a minor scandal involving the Mages Guild's lab security.
<--->
The Mages Guild lost another experiment apparently.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear they found out that atronach was made with the soul of %t's brother!
<--->
A lot of people feel safer knowing that atronach is dead.
<--->
Everybody's talking about that atronach that %ra hunted down?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
I haven't forgotten about the atronach crisis, if that's what's concerning you.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 I sent you to stop that atronach and
<ce>                     you failed. No excuses, %pcf.
<ce>                    Just leave me to my melancholia.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                      "I would rather die than go
<ce>                        back to the Mages Guild
<ce>                      laboratory." The life fades
<ce>                       from the atronach's eyes.
