QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    %pcf, I do not know even how to
<ce>               broach this subject. I need you to promise
<ce>               me on your ancestors' honor that you will
<ce>              do what you can to help me and never breathe
<ce>                of what I say or what you see to anyone
<ce>                   else anywhere. Will you so swear?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               It would be worse, I suppose, for you to
<ce>                swear and then not be true. Still, I had
<ce>                   hoped for more gallantry from you.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     I will trust you then, %pcf.
<ce>               The matter concerns my mother-in-law, the
<ce>                dowager queen of Daggerfall and widow of
<ce>                 Lysandus, Mynisera. As mistress of the
<ce>                household finances, I have noticed that
<ce>                she has been paying for the upkeep of a
<ce>                      fortress called ___myndung_
<ce>               complete with a large platoon of soldiers.
<ce>               A short while ago, she disappeared with a
<ce>              wrapped parcel of papers and came back days
<ce>                later with empty hands. She has recently
<ce>               left again with another parcel of letters
<ce>                and my spies have verified that she has
<ce>                     gone to ___myndung_. You will
<ce>                 have to trust that my suspicion of her
<ce>               activities is justifiable, for I am not in
<ce>               a position to offer proof. What I need for
<ce>                     you to do is go to ___myndung_
<ce>                 and find that parcel of letters or any
<ce>                 other information about her activities
<ce>                  there. Mynisera will be returning in
<ce>               =2myndung_ days. You cannot have any more
<ce>                   time than that, I fear. Good luck.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     I need some kind of evidence
<ce>                   in =2myndung_ days or less, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                How very sad. To be honest, this is not
<ce>                what I expected the letters to contain.
<ce>                 Poor Mynisera. Everyone at court knows
<ce>               that her husband, the late King Lysandus,
<ce>              preferred the face and form of another woman
<ce>               to her, but she still attempts to hide all
<ce>               evidence of it. Her loyalty to Lysandus is
<ce>               almost as great as his foolish loyalty to
<ce>                              the emperor.
<ce>                                    
<ce>              And those poor little children. How dreadful
<ce>             the butchery of the innocents. We know of the
<ce>               barbarism of the orcs, but surely they did
<ce>                not deserve that. Hardly surprising that
<ce>                Mynisera did not want it known that her
<ce>              father was responsible for such a grotesque
<ce>                  enterprise. Well, I thank you, %pcf,
<ce>               for your valor and your discretion. Please
<ce>               accept this small token of my esteem, not
<ce>                      as a payment but as a gift.
<ce>                          May %god bless thee.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                The letters are badly burned, but some
<ce>                        words can still be read.

%qdt:
 Queen Aubk-i wants me to follow her mother-in-law,
 the dowager queen of Daggerfall, to her fortress,
 ___myndung_ to see what becomes of the parcels of
 paper old Mynisera has been bringing there. I have
 only =2myndung_ days to get back to Aubk-i with the
 letters. She has promised me more information in return for this.

Message:  1015
<ce>             A stalwart young woman wearing the livery of
<ce>             Daggerfall presents you with a letter. Turning
<ce>              sharply she mounts her horse and rides away.

Message:  1020
Dear %pcn,
 
 I need your assistance once more. Your valor and
 discretion were invaluable when last you served
 me in the matter with Nulfaga. Please meet with
 me at Castle Daggerfall when next you pass through.
 
<ce>                                 Aubk-i
<ce>                          Queen of Daggerfall
