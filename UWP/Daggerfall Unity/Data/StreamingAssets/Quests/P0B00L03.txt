<ce>                       Might I interest you in a
<ce>                      dangerous assignment for the
<ce>                         greater glory of %vam?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  You want to leave it to another of
<ce>                     %vam and miss the honor? Very
<ce>                      well, but I admit that I am
<ce>                     disappointed by your docility.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     You are beautifully obedient,
<ce>                       %pcf. A rival vampire has
<ce>                      moved into my territory. You
<ce>                    are going to kill it. You should
<ce>                     be careful, %pcf.  A vampiric
<ce>                     ancient, even one from a tribe
<ce>                     inferior to %vam, is no feeble
<ce>                    adversary. Do not go into battle
<ce>                    without preparation. This one is
<ce>                           called _vampname_,
<ce>                    and %g3 new sanctuary is called
<ce>                     ___mondung_. He is known to be
<ce>                    overly proud of his _vampproof_
<ce>                   made from the skin of his victims.
<ce>                    Bring them back with you. I will
<ce>                        expect you back here in
<ce>                =1stparton_ nights. Do not get yourself
<ce>                             killed, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      Perhaps you were hoping for
<ce>                             _vampname_ to
<ce>                       commit suicide? Unlikely.
<ce>                        You must be the agent of
<ce>                               %g3 death.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Welcome back, %pcf, my child.
<ce>                  Curious thing: I was actually quite
<ce>                    concerned about your well-being.
<ce>                  What an absurdity -- sentimentality
<ce>                 in a vampire of %vam! I bring you the
<ce>                     congratulations of %vam elders
<ce>                      who bade me to give you this
<ce>                       _reward_. Do not think of
<ce>                  it as anything so vulgar as pay. It
<ce>                   is simply a gift from your family.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There's been a lot of activity at ___mondung_, but it's been abandoned for years.
<--->
That _vampname_ is an aristocrat. Says %g's cleaning up ___mondung_ and %reg.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_vampname_ finally moved out of ___mondung_, I hear. No place for an aristocrat.
<--->
Now that _vampname_ moved out of ___mondung_, %g's over at the palace a lot.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
It turns out that nice _vampname_ was a vampire! I had no idea!
<--->
Thank %god that wonderful %ra mercenary killed the vampire in ___mondung_.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Salutations, %pcf. I hope you're enjoying your new _reward_.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                        _vampname_ still walks
<ce>                         the night, %pcf. This
<ce>                      assignment was handled in an
<ce>                      unacceptable manner. All of
<ce>                        %vam is ... disappointed
<ce>                                in you.

Message:  1020
Dear %pcn,
 
    %vam have a potential
 problem I fear. Come to me in
 ___vampire_ soonest.
 
 In death,
<ce>                               _vampire_

Message:  1011

<ce>                     I have returned from the dead
<ce>                     once. I shall do so again. And
<ce>                     when I do I will hunt you and
<ce>                      _vampire_ down like the pale
<ce>                             worms you are!
