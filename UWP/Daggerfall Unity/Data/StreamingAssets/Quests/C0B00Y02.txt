QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 Would you be willing to assist in an
<ce>                            exorcism, %pct?
                                     <--->
<ce>                      _guardian_, a local knight,
<ce>                          has entreated us to
<ce>                  help %g3 ward, who has been showing
<ce>                signs of daedric possession. Would you
<ce>                be willing to assist with the exorcism,
<ce>                if that's what the situation requires?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   That's unfortunate. I hope we can
<ce>                        find someone else then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Would you? %oth, you have a
<ce>                      heart as big as %reg, %pct.
<ce>                     The child's name is _child_,
<ce>                          %g's a =child_ over
<ce>                     at _house_ here in __house_,
<ce>               but the person you'll want to speak with
<ce>                      is %g3 guardian, _guardian_
<ce>                         over in _tavern_. If
<ce>                 based on what %g has to say, you feel
<ce>                 that an exorcism is in order, go see
<ce>                         _priest_ in _house3_
<ce>                       of __house3_. I'll expect
<ce>                  this whole unfortunate affair to be
<ce>                 resolved in =queston_ days and to see
<ce>                       you here then. Good luck,
<ce>                           %god be with you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      Thank %god that situation's
<ce>                  resolved. You can never really tell
<ce>                  from the start whether an exorcism
<ce>       is really merited or not. You've done well, %pcf. Accept
<ce>                       this _reward_ as a small
<ce>                 token of our thanks for your efforts.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Poor little _child_. And poor _guardian_ having to watch %g3 ward suffer so.
<--->
The heart of ___house_ has really gone out to _child_ and %g3 terrible crisis.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_child_ and _guardian_ left ___guardian_.
<--->
We'll never know if _child_ was really possessed.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Everyone's thanking %god for the %ra who saved little _child_'s life.
<--->
Everything turned out all right for little _child_, so maybe %god does care.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
You helped __qgiver_ in that exorcism. What can I do for you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You left that child to suffer. I have nothing to say to you.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_
 wants me to see if a =child_ named
 _child_ in _house_
 is a victim of possession, and, if so,
 to cure %g2. I am to talk first with %g3
 guardian, _guardian_ of _tavern_.

Message:  1011
<ce>                  You've come from __qgiver_? Please
<ce>                 tell me you can help little _child_,
<ce>                  I can't stand to see %g2 suffer so.
<ce>               I don't know what to do with %g2. Please,
<ce>                take a look at %g2 and then see if you
<ce>                      can persuade that _priest_
<ce>                      to help. _child_ has always
<ce>                      been such a sweet =child_,
<ce>                but now ... If you want to see %g2, %g
<ce>                        is at _house_. I don't
<ce>                       know what else I can do.

Message:  1012
<ce>                     You're from __qgiver_? Thank
<ce>                    %god you're here. They say you
<ce>                         can get to _priest_,
<ce>                       the exorcist in _house3_
<ce>                    and %g has some special _item_
<ce>                  for possessions like this. I can't
<ce>                         convince _priest_ to
<ce>                     get me the _item_ myself, but
<ce>                  someone like you with the authority
<ce>                       of __qgiver_ could. Go to
<ce>                     __house3_ and talk to %g2. I
<ce>                      know you can convince %g2.

 _guardian_,
 the guardian of _child_,
 asked me to look at the child and
 then see if _priest_
 of _house3_, __house3_
 needs to perform an exorcism or
 not. _child_ is in
 _house_.

Message:  1014
%qdt:
 _guardian_,
 the guardian of _child_
 asked me to go to _house3_
 in __house3_ to ask
 _priest_ for some special
 _item_ to exorcise the daedric
 spirit from the child.

<ce>                          _child_ runs away.
<ce>                  And you can, indeed, feel an alien
<ce>                         presence in _house_.

Message:  1016
<ce>                          Oh, %oth, %oth ...
<ce>                      I feel ... so much better.
<ce>                          _guardian_ told me
<ce>                         that the _item_ would
<ce>                          help us, and %g was
<ce>                       right. Oh thank you, kind
<ce>                            %pct. I'll keep
<ce>                      this _item_ for protection.
<ce>                               Goodbye!

<ce>                  Gruh, you colly-eyed mortal greel,
<ce>                    I would open all your veins and
<ce>                  swim in your blood, steaming. They
<ce>                         call me =daedra_, the
<ce>                       licker of cat droppings!

<ce>                         Poor little _child_,
<ce>                   %g's rotting in Oblivion, and no
<ce>                  one will help %g2, but kind, kind,

<ce>                  There once was a girl named Vivian,
<ce>                     Who met =daedra_ of Oblivion,
<ce>                         They decided to mate,
<ce>                          and later they ate
<ce>                    _child_, their child, yum, yum.

Message:  1018
<ce>                        I'm sorry, %pcf, but I
<ce>                       can't give _item_ to just
<ce>                anyone who suspects they know a victim
<ce>                 of possession. It's far too rare and
<ce>                 expensive. You're going to have to at
<ce>                 least see the child before I agree to
<ce>                       parting with the _item_.

Message:  1019
<ce>                         =daedra_? _child_ did
<ce>                      mention the name =daedra_?
<ce>                Well, if this possession is a sham, it
<ce>                  is at least a well-researched one.
<ce>                       Here then is the _item_.
<ce>                  Just hold it with you when you next
<ce>                 speak with the child. But beware, the
<ce>                       daedra _child_ mentioned
<ce>                  is a Daedroth of great power. When
<ce>                   the exorcism is complete, it will
<ce>                    leave %g2 and appear elsewhere
<ce>                      in _house_. Be ready for a
<ce>                    battle when it does. Good luck,
<ce>                        %pcf. %god be with you.

Message:  1020
%qdt:
 I don't know who =daedra_ is, but that was the name
 _child_ spoke
 when I saw %g2. That =child_
 is possessed, mad, or the best
 actor in ___house_. It may be
 a good time to see the exorcist
 in __house3_, _priest_
 in _house3_.

Message:  1021
<ce>                       Good %pcf, I cannot thank
<ce>                   you enough for what you have done
<ce>                           for _child_. Now
<ce>                      %g's a happy, normal child
<ce>                       again. I've told _qgiver_
<ce>                       at your __qgiver_ as such
<ce>                    and %g's eager to congratulate
<ce>                      you. Once again, thank you.

Message:  1022
<ce>                       I can tell you where that
<ce>                        =guardian_, _guardian_
<ce>                  slipped off to, sure. But until you
<ce>                    got fifty gold to spare for the
<ce>                      info, I don't know nothing.

Message:  1023
<ce>                        Good day to thee, %pct.
<ce>                   You're probably looking for that
<ce>                        =guardian_, _guardian_,
<ce>                     who slipped out of here after
<ce>                   boasting about stealing some kind
<ce>                       of _item_ from __qgiver_.
<ce>                   If you have fifty gold pieces to
<ce>                    spare a friend, I could let you
<ce>                         know where _guardian_
<ce>                        went. What do you say?

Message:  1024
<ce>                     Nice doing business with you,
<ce>                           %pcf. You'll find
<ce>                         that =guardian_ over
<ce>                             in _house2_.

Message:  1025
<ce>                      "Don't hurt me!" _guardian_
<ce>                         hands you the _item_
<ce>                              and flees.

Message:  1026
%qdt:
 _hooker_, a =hooker_ over at
 _tavern_ told me (for fifty gold
 pieces) that that _guardian_ ran to
 _house2_ after _child_
 stole the _item_ from me. The possession was obviously
 a scam, and _priest_ and
 _qgiver_ will want the _item_ back.
