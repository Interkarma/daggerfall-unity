QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                     My name is _questgiver_. Can
<ce>                   you help me find my friend? I can
<ce>                       only pay you _gold_ gold.
                                     <--->
<ce>               Please help me. My friend _missingperson_
<ce>               is missing. I am afraid that %g might have
<ce>                 been hurt. I will pay you _gold_ gold
<ce>                        pieces if you find %g2.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Good day, %ra. I will look for someone else.
                                     <--->
<ce>                     Is no-one willing to help me?
                                     <--->
<ce>                     A thousand pardons. I mistook
<ce>                      you for a heroic adventurer.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            My prayers have been answered. _missingperson_
<ce>             has not been seen for four days, and I am very
<ce>             worried about %g2. %g has been seen consorting
<ce>                   with _friend1_ and _friend2_. You
<ce>              might want to start with them. If you can't
<ce>                 find _missingperson_ within two days,
<ce>                    you need not search any further.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Here is the _gold_ gold I promised you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
<ce>                  I hear _questgiver_ is frantically
<ce>                     searching for _missingperson_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
<ce>                    No one has seen _missingperson_
<ce>                 for days now. %g has been given up for
<ce>                  dead. I hear _questgiver_ is grief-
<ce>                           stricken over it.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
<ce>                 Say, aren't you that %ra that helped
<ce>                   _questgiver_ find _missingperson_?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
<ce>                   How can I turn down the %ra that
<ce>                     found _missingperson_ for me?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                 I know it wasn't your fault you were
<ce>                     unable to find _missingperson_
<ce>                for me. They found %g2 body in a gutter.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
On %qdt,
 I agreed to help _questgiver_ find
 _missingperson_. %g has been missing
 for four days. My only clues are that
 %g has been seen with _friend2_
 and _friend1_ recently. If
 I do not succeed within two days,
 I will not get paid.

Message:  1021
<ce>                  You're looking for _missingperson_?
<ce>                Well, %g is hiding in _hidingplace_,
<ce>                      but don't tell _questgiver_.
<ce>                      _missingperson_ has sworn to
<ce>                      never speak to _questgiver_
<ce>                        again. Don't ask me why.

Message:  1022
<ce>                  Have I seen _missingperson_ lately?
<ce>                  Sure. The guards caught %g2 stealing
<ce>                    from a temple. _questgiver_ will
<ce>                      be livid when %g finds out.

Message:  1023
<ce>                    Did _questgiver_ put you up to
<ce>                    this? I thought so. %oth, %g had
<ce>                        a nasty fight with
<ce>                         _missingperson_ a few
<ce>                       days ago. _missingperson_
<ce>               left town and hasn't been seen since. No,
<ce>                      I don't know where %g went.

Message:  1024
<ce>                       _missingperson_? Yeah, I
<ce>                       know what happened to %g2.
<ce>                      %g got killed, that's what.
<ce>                       My friend Smiley asked %g2
<ce>                      real nice for %g3 gold, and
<ce>                        %g wouldn't hand it over.
<ce>                     You really should meet Smiley
<ce>                     and my other friends. Get the
<ce>                              %ra, Smiley!

Message:  1031
<ce>                     _missingperson_? Naw. Haven't
<ce>                     seen %g2 for a couple of days.
<ce>                     Try asking _friend3_. %g might
<ce>                                 know.

Message:  1032
<ce>                 %oth. I haven't seen _missingperson_
<ce>              since the day before yesterday. You could
<ce>                      ask _friend4_ or _friend1_.
<ce>                        One of them might know.

Message:  1033
<ce>                      _friend1_ told you I might
<ce>                 know something about _missingperson_?
<ce>                   Afraid not. All I know is %g went
<ce>                 out drinking last night. Hope nothing
<ce>                          bad happened to %g2.

Message:  1034
<ce>               Sorry, I haven't seen _missingperson_ in
<ce>                       a while. I don't know why
<ce>                        _friend2_ would send you
<ce>                        to me... Have you tried
<ce>                               _friend1_?

Message:  1040
<ce>                      What are you doing here? I
<ce>                         don't ever want to see
<ce>                      _questgiver_ again. Hey! let
<ce>                     me go! You can't just drag me
<ce>                      through the streets to %g2.

Message:  1050
<ce>                       _missingperson_! I didn't
<ce>                    expect you to actually bring %g2
<ce>                      here, %pcn. _missingperson_,
<ce>                     where have you been? I've been
<ce>                        worried about you. %pcf,
<ce>                        I'll take it from here.

Message:  1051
<ce>                    So, _missingperson_ is hiding,
<ce>                     eh? I'll go get that miscreant
<ce>                    out of %g3 hiding place. You've
<ce>                        been very helpful, %pcn.

Message:  1052
<ce>                    In jail!? I have to leave right
<ce>                      away. Maybe I can bribe the
<ce>                              magistrate.

Message:  1053
<ce>                        So _missingperson_ has
<ce>                    left town? %g didn't need to do
<ce>                    that. I would have forgiven %g2.

Message:  1054
<ce>                     Dead!? How can that be? I hope
<ce>                      you made that Smiley suffer,
<ce>                         %pcn. This is a day of
<ce>                          great sorrow for me.
