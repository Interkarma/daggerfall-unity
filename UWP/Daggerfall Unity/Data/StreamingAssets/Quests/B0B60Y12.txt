<ce>                    Have I got a good one for you.
<ce>                        It seems _nobleman_ just
<ce>                      read about an ancient family
<ce>                      curse. Now %g is scared out
<ce>                     of %g3 mind. %g wants someone
<ce>                    to go destroy %g3 great, great,
<ce>                       great grandmother, whom %g
<ce>                      fears walks the earth as an
<ce>                      undead monstrosity. Are you
<ce>                           interested, %pct?
                                     <--->
<ce>                 This may potentially be nothing more
<ce>                   than a simple poke around a tomb,
<ce>                      but _nobleman_ has asked us
<ce>                    to investigate the resting place
<ce>                    of %g3 great, great, great grand
<ce>                   mother. Apparently %g had a dream
<ce>                    that %g had been brought to life
<ce>                    and would escape from the family
<ce>                     burial mound in =2dung_ days.
<ce>                   Perhaps it is all perfect rot, but
<ce>                   perhaps not. Will you investigate,
<ce>                                 %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   If you run into any knights that
<ce>                     might take this job, send them
<ce>                                 to me.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     _nobleman_'s ancient ancestor
<ce>                    is entombed in a mausoleum named
<ce>                          ___dungeon_ that was
<ce>                   designed to prevent graverobbing.
<ce>                     There is no proof she is even
<ce>                     undead. Odds are she's just a
<ce>                    corpse. If so, burn the body in
<ce>                    a proper funeral pyre. Get back
<ce>                   within =2dung_ days, or _nobleman_
<ce>                   says the curse will be triggered.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Well I'll be. I didn't figure
<ce>                       _nobleman_'s ancestor was
<ce>                    really one of the walking dead!
<ce>                    You have saved the local people
<ce>                       much misery and suffering.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_nobleman_ is a superstitious fool, but %g3 great grandmother was an odd one.
<--->
_nobleman_ comes a strange family. Maybe %g3 great grandmother is a zombie.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
%kno looked into _nobleman_'s story and, I guess, decided it was a hoax.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_nobleman_'s great, great grandmother was undead after all! How about that?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
After saving %reg from an undead menace we didn't know we had, what can I do?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
As a matter of fact, I know _nobleman_'s story wasn't a hoax, you sluggard!
<--->
I happen to know there was a real monster in ___dungeon_, you dormouse!
<--->
You failed %kno when you failed _nobleman_, %pcf.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 ==qgiver_ in ___qgiver_
 charged me with the duty of
 cremating the corpse of
 _nobleman_'s ancient ancestor
 in ___dungeon_. There is
 a chance it is an undead
 horror, which will need to
 be put to rest. I have =2dung_
 days to finish the quest.

Message:  1011
<ce>                    The _monster_ is laid to rest.
<ce>                       _nobleman_ need not worry
<ce>                         about that curse now.
