<ce>                Here's a rather amusing accounting that
<ce>               may appeal to your morbid sense of humor.
<ce>                   Seems there's this untalented bard
<ce>                   with a penchant for rude limericks
<ce>                 about former patrons. As it turns out,
<ce>                %g3 knowledge of genealogy was lacking,
<ce>                 and %g sang a song about an incestuous
<ce>                 duke to %g3 new patroness, the duke's
<ce>                daughter. Interested in accounting this
<ce>               uncouth artiste for _reward_ gold pieces?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Did I misunderstand you, or did you
<ce>                  really say no? How do you expect to
<ce>                    appreciate the rich tapestry of
<ce>                    humanity if you don't have time
<ce>                      to butcher a lousy musician?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                I thought it would appeal. Apparently,
<ce>                   the bard is aware of our contract
<ce>                 and is hiding in a dismal hole called
<ce>                              ___mondung_.
<ce>                     Shouldn't be more than a minor
<ce>                   scuffle, but do not let down your
<ce>                   guard. A desperate songster can be
<ce>                  an unpredictable adversary. Be back
<ce>                     in =1stparton_ days to collect
<ce>                    your accounting fee. Good luck.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     I'm willing to bet that bard
<ce>                     is not launched into Oblivion
<ce>                       yet. But you're here. That
<ce>                    seems odd to me. Does it to you?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Ah, did you stay to hear the final
<ce>                note from that boorish instrumentalist?
<ce>                Here's your cut for being the instrument
<ce>                         of the bard's requiem:
<ce>                      _reward_ gold pieces. Enjoy.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I wonder whether that duke really did have incest with his daughter.
<--->
That poor _monster_ couldn't even carry a tune anyhow.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Well, =monster_ may have moved on but we'll always remember %g3 songs.
<--->
I hear that duchess is madder than a magister about the bard getting away.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
They say you can still hear =monster_'s mocking song in the breeze at night.
<--->
I, for one, am happy that =monster_'s dead; %g was an awful bore.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, hello, %pcf. 'Tis music to my eyes to see thee again.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                      How can I greet thee, %pcf?
<ce>                You have failed to slay the bard. A very
<ce>                   sour note on your record, indeed.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
<ce>                       You have slain =monster_.
