QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                My husband's poor grandmother, Nulfaga,
<ce>                is rumored to be in very frail health,
<ce>                her once brilliant mind almost utterly
<ce>                 destroyed. She has locked herself in
<ce>                her castle in the Wrothgarian Mountains
<ce>                and experiments in magical studies with
<ce>                 no regard for her own safety. I would
<ce>              know of her condition, but few possess the
<ce>               bravery to face the horrors of her castle
<ce>              and speak with her. My reward for a report
<ce>                    on her health is a magical _magicitem_.
<ce>                   Will you be my champion in this?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  A common enough response. But very
<ce>                      disappointing nevertheless.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    %oth, I am glad to have found a
<ce>                  champion. The name of her castle is
<ce>                Shedungent, and it should not take you
<ce>              longer than =2shedungent_ days to go there
<ce>              and return. If she is insane, Shedungent
<ce>               may be a very dangerous place indeed.
<ce>           Be very careful. May Kynareth and Mara protect you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  Until you have spoken with Nulfaga,
<ce>                 I am not interested in conversation.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               I confess I doubted I would ever see you
<ce>                again. Your news that Nulfaga is still
<ce>               among the living does my heart much good.
<ce>                       Here is your _magicitem_.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Why has the Queen developed this sudden affection for crazy old Nulfaga?
<--->
Nulfaga is nothing but an insane witch. Why does Queen Aubk-i care if she dies?

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The Queen has sent yet another mercenary after that %ra failed to find Nulfaga.
<--->
Queen Aubk-i couldn't wait for that %ra any longer. She sent another mercenary.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
It is nice to see Queen Aubk-i happy at last. She has a very pretty smile.
<--->
Queen Aubk-i seems more than happy lately. She seems almost ... relieved.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Thank you once again for taking that dangerous trip to Shedungent to look in on Nulfaga for me.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Ah, %pcn. The %ra that refused to visit my husband's grandmother.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 Aubk-i, the Queen of Daggerfall has asked
 me to check on the condition of her
 grandmother-in-law, Nulfaga. I am to go
 to Nulfaga's castle, Shedungent of Wrothgaria,
 and talk to her to see if she is well.
 I have =2shedungent_ days to report her condition
 to Aubk-i and get my reward.

<ce>               United thoughts and counsels, equal hope
<ce>              and hazard in the once glorious enterprise
<ce>              joined with me once, now misery hath joined
<ce>               in equal ruin! Eternal, eternal, eternal
<ce>               ruin. I tell the door to my soul to shut
<ce>                up. Oh, my child, why wouldst thou not
<ce>              listen, thy ear, thy glorious mortal face,
<ce>                 thy throat, and the arrow. Oh misery.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 Choosing out few words most horrible,
<ce>               let none them read! Verses, verses frame
<ce>               which with and other spells like terrible
<ce>                curses Heaven! Curse Oblivion! My boy!
<ce>                My boy is dead and let Tamriel tremble
<ce>                 until he and I findeth peace denied.
<ce>               Shut up the door to his tomb and my home.
                                     <--->
<ce>            Say, what strange motive, Goddess! could compel
<ce>             an arrow to my beloved Lysandus' bare throat?
<ce>              Did he die there mourned and blessed or are
<ce>              my pretty birdies all turned to graywings?
<ce>             Oh doorway to my heart, shut up lest I sunder
<ce>            thee. I search the afterworld, the underworld,
<ce>             and the world-between and no where do I find
<ce>              the lightness of my son. Oh, madness to thy
<ce>                       breast I cling suckling!
                                     <--->
<ce>                We are only like dead walls or vaulted
<ce>               graves, that, ruined, yield no echo. Oh,
<ce>                this gloomy world, in what a shadow or
<ce>                deep pit of darkness doth, womanish and
<ce>               fearful, mankind live. How came Lysandus
<ce>               by his death? In a mist, I know not how.
<ce>             Oblivion not come yet? Shut up mine door and
<ce>             keep out its gray skies. I'll move it nearer
<ce>             by a perspective, or make a glass that shall
<ce>              set all the world on fire upon an instant.
<ce>               I cannot sleep; my pillow is stuffed with
<ce>                        a litter of porcupines.
