QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              I need someone to bring a certain item to a
<ce>                    contact of mine in ___contact_.
<ce>              You will receive an item in return. If you
<ce>              bring that item back to me, I will happy to
<ce>                 reward you with _reward_ gold pieces.
<ce>                             Do you agree?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                No? What a shame. I was prepared to be
<ce>                            quite generous.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Very good. Take this bar of gold
<ce>                  and bring it to a certain =contact_
<ce>                  called _contact_ in a place called
<ce>                      __contact_ in ___contact_.
<ce>                    You will need to move quickly.
<ce>                    _contact_ isn't in the habit of
<ce>                 waiting around for laggard couriers.
<ce>                  Very well, good luck to you, %pcf.
<ce>              I will expect you back in =1stparton_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                Please don't bother me again unless you
<ce>                 have the item I sent you to pick up.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Excellent, %pcf, you've returned
<ce>            with my enchanted _item2_ as promised. I heard
<ce>              that you ran into some trouble on the road,
<ce>              and I was beginning to worry that you were
<ce>              lost to us.  As a token of my appreciation
<ce>           for a job well done, I am adding a magic _item3_
<ce>              to the _reward_ gold I originally promised.
<ce>              I am sure we will make use of your services
<ce>                 again in the near future. Thank you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There was this =contact_ here recently asking if I'd seen a %ra.
<--->
Some =contact_ was looking for a %ra with a _item1_ a while back.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
Well, _questgiver_ is, I've heard, furious at some %ra mercenary.
<--->
_questgiver_ is still relying on mercenaries and I've heard %g's been burned.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
I hear that _questgiver_ finally got some _item2_ %g needed.
<--->
_questgiver_ has been singing the praises of a certain %ra mercenary.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
And what can I do for you, my brave young courier?
<--->
I'd be happy to help out my favorite courier any way I can.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>              The delivery was obviously too ... complex,
<ce>                  eh? Ah, the vapidity of %ra youth.
<ce>                          Leave me now, %pcf.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_ has sent me to
 an associate of %g3, _contact_
 of __contact_, ___contact_,
 with a bar of gold. I need to have the
 gold in _contact_'s hands and
 be back in __questgiver_ in
 =1stparton_ days to get my _reward_
 gold pieces from
 _questgiver_.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      Marvelous, %pcf. I do adore
<ce>                gold, don't you? Well, you'll get your
<ce>              share once you've returned this particular
<ce>                       _item2_ to _questgiver_.
<ce>                  I hope you remember the way back to
<ce>                            ___questgiver_.

Message:  1015
_qgenemy_ ... I think %g's from __thievesguild_.
<--->
_qgenemy_?  Ask around __thievesguild_.  Someone should know %g2.

Message:  1016
<ce>   _qgenemy_ is involved in most shady dealings in __thievesguild_.
<ce>    Try _thievesguild_ -- that's where %g spends most of %g3 time.

Message:  1020
<ce>          As you fend off your assailant, you feel something
<ce>              brush against you from behind.  You glimpse
<ce>            a figure running away before your attention is
<ce>             forcibly returned to keeping yourself alive.

Message:  1021
=thief_,
 
 The mark is a %ra named %pcn,
 who will pick up a _item2_ from
 __contact_.  Bring the _item2_
 to me.  The courier is of no importance,
 dead or alive.
 
<ce>                               _qgenemy_

Message:  1030
<ce>            %oth, who are you and how did you get in here?!
<ce>          You must be that damned courier of _questgiver_'s!
<ce>          I knew I should have had =thief_ kill you.  My soft
<ce>            heart, always getting me in trouble ... Guards!
<ce>                         Kill this intruder!!

Message:  1035
<ce>                 The parchment describes the location
<ce>                 of the Coven of the Tide in Myrkwasa,
<ce>                           whatever that is.
