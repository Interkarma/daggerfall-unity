QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>            Ah, my friend. I regret to admit that I made a
<ce>            poor business decision, but facts are facts. I
<ce>            loaned a certain sum of money to a noble by the
<ce>                  name of _patsy_, who you may or may
<ce>            not have heard of. The security on the loan was
<ce>             the deed to a valuable piece of property. Now
<ce>                    _patsy_ and the deed have both
<ce>           vanished. Rumor has it that %g fell on some hard
<ce>             time financially, but the sum I loaned is not
<ce>             easily swallowed by my enterprises. Tangling
<ce>                    with the likes of _patsy_ will
<ce>              likely be dangerous, but I need a champion.
<ce>             Will you help me, my friend, in exchange for
<ce>                        a large uncut diamond?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                I am sorry to hear that. I understand,
<ce>                  of course, but it is disappointing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             That's good to hear. Now then, I have thirty
<ce>              days before I will be forced to dip into my
<ce>              capital. The deed was stolen out of a local
<ce>                    establishment called _bank_ in
<ce>              __bank_ together with some other valuables,
<ce>                 but the coincidence between _patsy_'s
<ce>              disappearance at the same time the deed did
<ce>                    merits investigation. _patsy_'s
<ce>                     old residence was _house2_ in
<ce>                   __house2_, which I understand is
<ce>             now empty. Other than that, I have no leads.
<ce>                    I either need the gold _patsy_
<ce>               borrowed, the deed to the house, or that
<ce>                aristocrat's head on a stick in thirty
<ce>                    days. Don't let me down, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                        You could at least try
<ce>                       to fulfill your promise.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 _patsy_'s trick didn't work, did it,
<ce>                 %pcf? Here's the diamond I promised.
<ce>                         Well done, my friend.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_qgiver_ sure wasn't _patsy_'s only dupe. Lots of people loaned %g2 gold.
<--->
_patsy_ just left __house2_ suddenly, leaving debts and broken hearts behind.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_patsy_ got away with it all, looks like. I hear %g's up north with a fortune.
<--->
_patsy_'s supposedly dead. I don't believe that for a second.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
No one's going to try to default on _qgiver_, not after that _patsy_ affair.
<--->
All _patsy_ proved was it's not wise to try and cheat someone like _qgiver_.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 I have thirty days
 to find the deed that _qgiver_,
 of __qgiver_, in ___qgiver_ was
 given as collateral on a loan to a noble
 named _patsy_, or to find the gold
 _qgiver_ gave _patsy_,
 or, if all else fails, to find the
 nowhere-to-be-found _patsy_.
 The collateral was in _bank_ in
 __bank_, before the bank was robbed.
 The only other place I've been told
 of is _house2_,
 _patsy_'s old place of residence
 in __house2_.
 If I am successful in any of these goals
 in thirty days, _qgiver_ will
 give me a large, uncut diamond.

Message:  1011
Do you give _hooker_ the gold?

Message:  1012
<ce>            Thank you, sweets. I've heard you're the decent
<ce>            sort, and I thought I'd give you a break. I was
<ce>                   hired by _patsy_ a few weeks ago --
<ce>          not for the reason you're thinkin. All I had to
<ce>           do was flirt with some old gaffer and get him to
<ce>          ask me out to dinner on a specific day. I guess to
<ce>          get him out of his house, because I found out later
<ce>            that the bloke's house was burgled while we was
<ce>          out. Lots of stuff was took, I hear. The old fella
<ce>            was cute and sweet and I felt bad about it. You
<ce>             may want to talk to him. His name's _gaffer_.
<ce>             Or you could go to the place where I met that
<ce>                    _patsy_, _house2_ in __house2_
<ce>             and see if anyone there knows anything. Hope
<ce>               all this helps, %pcf. I'd like to see old
<ce>                       _patsy_ put away myself.

Message:  1013
%pcn,
 
 If you are anticipating a long and healthy career
 in the Bay area, I would advise dropping your pointless
 and doomed hounding. Tragedy is the only possible
 result, and the tragedy will be your own.
 I won't be caught, %pcf. I have too much money
 to be caught.
 
 
 
 Yours truly,
 
 
 _patsy_

Message:  1014
<ce>                      %pcn is your target, a %ra
<ce>             adventurer and mercenary. Use extreme caution
<ce>                     and be prepared for a fight.

_banker_ works over at _bank_ in __bank_. Perfectly respectable sort.
<--->
A banker of typical tediousness. _banker_ works at _bank_ in __bank_.

Message:  1016
<ce>                  I'll tell you what I told _patsy_.
<ce>                __banker_ will reimburse all gold lost
<ce>                in the robbery down to the last penny.
<ce>                    We just want to answer certain
<ce>                  questions about the robbery itself.
<ce>                      Things it would be best not
<ce>                      discussed with a stranger,
<ce>                            you understand.

Message:  1017
<ce>                     Ah, good to see you, %pcf. We
<ce>                 are having a bit of excitement lately
<ce>                with the robbery and all. Only certain
<ce>                 accounts and deposits were targeted,
<ce>                    so _guard_, our security agent,
<ce>                 is looking into the holders of those
<ce>                  accounts. Perhaps %g might be able
<ce>                  to give you more information, %pcf.
<ce>                        _guard_ is at __guard_
<ce>                             in ___guard_.

Message:  1018
<ce>              I'm afraid I can't discuss this matter with
<ce>                 you, %pcn. This affair only concerns
<ce>                  _patsy_ and myself, no one else. If
<ce>             you're really interested in helping, go chat
<ce>                    with _hooker_, a prostitute who
<ce>             had some kind of relationship with our friend
<ce>                 _patsy_. She'll want ten gold pieces
<ce>               to cooperate, and you'll find her over in
<ce>                      __house1_ in a place called
<ce>                      _house1_. Good luck, %pcf.
<ce>               I may not be here when you get back, but
<ce>               you are certainly capable of carrying on
<ce>                    the investigations on your own.

Message:  1019
<ce>                    Ah, %pcn, my friend. I think we
<ce>            may be able to help each other in this affair.
<ce>                    I know where _patsy_ has gone,
<ce>               but %g3 allies are making it difficult to
<ce>              get to %g2. Millions of gold pieces can buy
<ce>             some powerful friends. I need you to cut off
<ce>              this connection, and then meet me so we can
<ce>                       together cut off _patsy_
<ce>                altogether. Drop this letter off in %g3
<ce>                  allies' stronghold ___mondung_ and
<ce>                 then come to ___mondung2_. With luck,
<ce>               the letter should distract those soldiers
<ce>                     so _patsy_ will be relatively
<ce>                defenseless, except for %g3 own guards
<ce>                 of course. Very good, %pcf, I will be
<ce>                           seeing you soon.

Message:  1020
_guard_ has left __guard_. Apparently %g knows where _patsy_ has gone.
<--->
_guard_ wouldn't have left __guard_ unless %g knew where _patsy_ is hiding.
<--->
Everyone's trying to figure out why _guard_ left __guard_ so suddenly.

Message:  1021
<ce>           Change of agenda, folks. I need you in ___qgiver_
<ce>         right away. Get over there and wait for my response.

Message:  1024
<ce>               You have slain _patsy_, without a doubt.

Message:  1025
I'm going to need some reinforcements if the
 rumors about this %ra are correct.
 Keep the deed in hiding in ___mondung_
 but bring the gold and your men over here to
 ___mondung2_. We'll discuss this further
 when you arrive.

<ce>                There is a stamp on the piece of _rock_
<ce>                        that reads ___mondung_.

Message:  1027
Just a piece of _rock_. Odd finding it lying around ___house2_.
<--->
The _rock_ seems to have some kind of stamp on it, or an engraving.
<--->
Looks like the stuff they used to mine out of ___mondung_.

Message:  1028
The _rock_ says ___mondung_ on it; that's an abandoned mine to the %di.
<--->
That _rock_ must have been mined years ago when ___mondung_ was a mine.

Message:  1029
<ce>                   This looks like the deed _patsy_
<ce>                     gave _qgiver_ as collateral.

Message:  1030
<ce>                   This appears to be the gold that

 Dear %pcf,
 
 
      We understand that you are looking for _patsy_.
 Because we respect you and your work, we have decided to help
 you in this matter. _patsy_ used our services once
 some weeks ago, and we received our payments through a small
 but fierce band of %g3 allies garrisoned at a camp
 called ___mondung_. If you are truly interested in
 finding _patsy_, you would be smart to start there.
      Good luck and may Mephala steady thy aim.

Message:  1032
<ce>         You do not even realize that the young boy is next to
<ce>         you until you feel the letter slip into your hand. By
<ce>         the time you turn, he has disappeared, scurrying away
<ce>          so quickly you do not have a hope of catching him.

Message:  1033
%pcn,
 
      _patsy_ is a thief, but not one of ours. We
 would like %g2 to be caught as well. Please accept this
 contribution to your expenses, and this other bit of
 information: _patsy_ is not working alone.
 There is a gang of mercenaries under %g3 direction
 in a place called ___mondung_. Some of %g3
 treasure may be kept there as well, but I do not think
 _patsy_ is there.
      Good luck, %pcf, and walk with Baan Dar.

Message:  1034
<ce>            Ah, %pcf, my friend. Again, I have been seduced
<ce>         and betrayed. Truly I should join some monastery. My
<ce>              life would be simpler without women, %oth.
<ce>          Here, take this gold as my contribution toward the
<ce>                capture of that wicked _patsy_. I only
<ce>          wish I could afford to give more, but after recent
<ce>           events, I am impoverished. For your information,
<ce>                   _patsy_ has two hideouts in %reg,
<ce>              one in ___mondung_ and one in ___mondung2_.
<ce>         I do not know which if either of these is being used
<ce>           currently, but I would advise you to prepare your
<ce>                finest blade. _patsy_ will not go down
<ce>                easily. Good luck and %god be with you.

Message:  1035
<ce>         Why should I tell you anything I know about anything?
<ce>              You're just a patsy of _qgiver_ who'd screw
<ce>            me like _patsy_ screwed me or that %god damned
<ce>               _hooker_ screwed me. Find some hole like
<ce>                ___mondung_ to crawl in, wither up, and
<ce>                die, you child of a chancred %ra whore.

Message:  1036
Dear %pcn,
 
      I might have some information that might help
 your search for that rat _patsy_. If you're
 interested, ask for me in __house1_ at a
 dump called _house1_. And bring 10 gold
 pieces with you. This information ain't free.

<ce>            whispers and a young courier hands you a note.
<ce>                Before you can react, he scurries away.
