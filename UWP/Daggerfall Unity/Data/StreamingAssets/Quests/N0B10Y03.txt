<ce>                      The Mages Guild is in need
<ce>                        of someone to guard the
<ce>                      magical _treasure_ tonight.
<ce>                     Is it feasible that you could
<ce>                        do it for us? There's a
<ce>                        _potion_ in it for you.
                                     <--->
<ce>                    The Guildhall -- how should one
<ce>                   put this? In life, I think you'll
<ce>                  agree, there are always some people
<ce>                    who just ... well, the Guild has
<ce>                   always stood for, or, rather, had
<ce>                    problems with ... Listen, young
<ce>                 %pct, we need a guard. Will you do it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     No problem. There are always
<ce>                      other guild members looking
<ce>                               for work.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                         Be at the Mages Guild
<ce>                      by midnight. Your period of
<ce>                         guardianship will last
<ce>                       until 3:00 in the morning.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        Well done, %pcf. Those
<ce>                     thieves didn't stand a chance
<ce>                      against you. Here, take this
<ce>                             _potion_. It's
<ce>                      really the least we can do.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The thieves must think that _treasure_ in the Mages Guild is very valuable.
<--->
The thieves have been threatening to steal the Mages Guild's _treasure_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
The thieves finally got that _treasure_ after all.
<--->
The Mages Guild should've got real guards. That's why they lost the _treasure_

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Those thieves aren't going to try to get that _treasure_ again, I bet.
<--->
The thieves who tried to get that _treasure_ didn't expect a real guard, I bet.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
How are you, %pcf? Found any use for that _potion_ yet?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                        The _treasure_ is gone,
<ce>                   but you're here? That's hardly an
<ce>                        equal exchange, I think.
<ce>                            Leave me, %pcn.

 I couldn't resist it. I took
 the _treasure_ I was
 supposed to guard. They'll
 be after me for sure.

Message:  1012
<ce>                      Lookee here boys. A guard.
<ce>                        Gee, I'm all scared and
<ce>                        shaking. Lets leave the
<ce>                        tongue on the door as a
<ce>                        warning not to mess with
<ce>                      the thieves guild. Get him!

<ce>                      I claim bounty on the thief

<ce>                                 Guild.
