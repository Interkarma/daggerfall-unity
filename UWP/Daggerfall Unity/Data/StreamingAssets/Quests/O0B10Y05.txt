<ce>                            Ho there %pcf!
<ce>                       You remember me, _qgiver_?
<ce>                         Are up for a guild job
<ce>                       today? I got one here that
<ce>                       seems right up your alley.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                           Maybe next time.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       This rich guy just got a
<ce>                             painting that
<ce>                      could fetch a nice price. He
<ce>                       stashed it at _townhouse_
<ce>                            in __townhouse_.
<ce>                       Bring it back and you get
<ce>                       a guild fee of _gold_ gold
<ce>                       pieces. Oh yeah, I need it
<ce>                       within =traveltime_ days.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Hardly a scratch on it. Sorry
<ce>                     about the guardian. We didn't
<ce>                    know he had gone and done that.
<ce>                            Here's your pay.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_townhouse_ is a veritable art gallery.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
I got a boil the other day ... but it healed.
<--->
I just had a three hour conversation about the weather.
<--->
The weather is pretty usual for this time of year.
<--->
It seems a trifle coolish in %cn for this time of year.
<--->
It sure is a lot warmer today than this time last year.
<--->
My great aunt is going to a specialist across the Bay.
<--->
It's always funny what time it gets dark around here.
<--->
We should erect a war statue around here.
<--->
The kids these days with their magic. %oth, I don't know.
<--->
I had the weirdest dream last night.
<--->
I heard a great joke. %jok
<--->
%jok Actually, that's a joke.
<--->
%jok Can you explain that to me?
<--->
The legal system in %reg has its good points and bad ones.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
_townhouse_ was robbed, even though it had a powerful guardian.
<--->
Whoever robbed _townhouse_ must've known what he was doing.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
That painting fetched a great price on the black market, %pcf.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                     Well, I see you, but I don't
<ce>                     see the painting that you were
<ce>                    supposed to get. Why did I even
<ce>                        waste my breath on you?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
