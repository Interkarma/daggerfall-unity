<ce>                        You are not a member of
<ce>                            __qgiver_, %pcn.
<ce>                        However, you seem honest
<ce>                      enough. I'll tell you what.
<ce>                        A house over in __house_
<ce>                        is being haunted by some
<ce>                        sort of undead. We need
<ce>                        someone to exorcise the
<ce>                         spirit. Do this and it
<ce>                         may change how we feel
<ce>                               about you.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       This isn't going to look
<ce>                           good to __qgiver_.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                       If the haunt is too tough
<ce>                      for you to handle yourself,
<ce>                       don't do anything stupid.
<ce>                       Go to _house_ in __house_.
<ce>                    You have =traveltime_ days or we
<ce>                        send someone else out to
<ce>                              do the job.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    So you exorcised the place, eh?
<ce>                    This will look good for you when
<ce>                   I speak with the temple hierarchs.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_house_ is haunted by many powerful, evil spirits, they say.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_house_ is still haunted, despite the attempts of ==qgiver_.

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
At last, _house_ has only good, household spirits within.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Oh, hullo, my friend, the exorcist. How may I help thee?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
I gave thee a chance before, and it was a waste of breath.
<--->
Do you think that I forgot _house_ already, %pct?

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of __qgiver_,
 in ___qgiver_ has given
 me the chance to rid _house_
 in __house_ of an
 undead haunting. I have =traveltime_
 days to do the job.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      In life I built this house.
<ce>                     What right do the living have
<ce>                    to interrupt my deathly dreams?

Message:  1012
<ce>                    Well, at least you tried. I'll
<ce>                     not speak ill of you, but that
<ce>                      is all I can promise, %pcn.

Message:  1080
<ce>                      In addition, here is a map
<ce>                           to ___newdung_, an
<ce>                    unclean pit of a place if there
<ce>                     ever was one.  Do %reg a favor
<ce>                       and exterminate the vermin
<ce>                             infesting it.
