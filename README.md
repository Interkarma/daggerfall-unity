# Get Daggerfall Unity

Daggerfall Unity requires a free copy of DOS Daggerfall to run. This provides all necessary game assets such as textures, 3D models, and sound effects.

You can get a free copy of DOS Daggerfall from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/) and a free copy of Daggerfall Unity from the [Releases](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/releases) page. Then simply unzip the latest version of Daggerfall Unity to its own folder and point it to the DOS version. Daggerfall Unity will take care of everything else.

Here are a couple of links with more detailed steps to help you get started using either Steam or a cross-platform process.

Instead of increasing chance to avoid an attack completely, armor now reduces the damage you take, based on the material as well as the type of attack. Skills now determine most of your chance to avoid attacks, including many more features.
